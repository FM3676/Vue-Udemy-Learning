1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,168
Now that's it for the course,

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:06,370
this was a lot of content.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,450
So definitely,

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,530
it's time for some Congratulations,

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,290
you did an amazing job.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,450
You pulled through this entire course.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,210
And you therefore learned a ton about view.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,790
This course obviously has a lot of content

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,970
because it's well,

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,210
the complete guide on view

11
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,220
and not that I do cover some parts only guide.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,400
But that was a lot of content to digest

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,704
and therefore the obvious question is,

14
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,570
how should you continue?

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,300
How can you make sure that you don't lose the knowledge

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,870
you gained in this course?

17
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,210
Maybe you lost some concepts already.

18
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,370
And that wouldn't be horrible by the way,

19
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,336
that would be totally normal.

20
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,178
Well, here are some next steps I recommend.

21
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:51,440
The most important step as boring as it is,

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,990
is that you practice, practice and well guess what?

23
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,690
Practice.

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,880
Also revisit course lectures and modules,

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,260
So that concepts which you have forgotten by now,

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,349
are refreshed.

27
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,270
And then use all of that to do the assignments

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,770
you find in this course,

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,560
to rebuild the course project

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,414
without looking at the solution first,

31
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:16,150
but instead on your own,

32
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,530
and then maybe go through the solution again with me,

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,980
so that you can see how you build it,

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,390
where that differs compared to my approach,

35
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,840
and why maybe something might not be working.

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,803
Maybe something is also better than the way I built it.

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,830
But also explored the official docs.

38
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,720
This course covers all the core concepts view

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,200
has to offer in great depth.

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,840
But of course, this does not mean that

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,740
it's the only resource on view out there.

42
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,380
The official docs are really well written,

43
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,760
and a great resource to dig deeper

44
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,483
or quickly look up a certain concept.

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,440
But last but not least you can only grow as a developer,

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,320
if you build stuff.

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,680
You need to build demo and dummy projects,

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,320
maybe build clones of popular websites,

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,080
build your own simplified Facebook site,

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,870
at least the front end of it,

51
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,010
and dive into challenging problems.

52
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,670
And then don't give up.

53
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,080
But look for solutions with Google with Stack Overflow,

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,610
Maybe with the community you find linked

55
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,360
at the beginning of this course,

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,460
there are plenty of resources for that.

57
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,110
And all of that will allow you to grow as a view developer.

58
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,950
You can also dig into some average view courses

59
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,080
like my next course,

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,736
which uses a technology that builds up on view to build

61
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:44,530
view applications where some code is actually rendered

62
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,660
on the server and not just in the browser.

63
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,720
All these things can be great next steps.

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,160
And with the very solid foundation you gained

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,270
in this course,

66
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,150
you have everything you need to take these steps.

67
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,030
I wish you all the best for this,

68
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,370
and I really want to thank you for being part of the course,

69
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,910
and for allowing me to be part of your journey

70
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,943
in this course.
