1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,380
So let's deploy our dist folder content,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,540
and they mentioned that there are many options

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,962
for hosting static web apps.

4
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:14,220
AWS is free, Netlify, Firebase hosting.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,980
I will go with Firebase since we've been using that

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,180
in earlier parts of the course already.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,430
So you probably have a Firebase project by now,

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,893
and hence hosting will be easy to set up.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,350
You can simply click on hosting and your project,

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,430
and you could also create a new project for hosting.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,480
It's doesn't have to be the same one

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,590
as you have for your Firebase database, just as a side note.

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,470
But here, I will use the same one

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,050
and I will click on hosting,

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,700
and you'll find instructions here, but in the end,

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,300
hosting is really simple.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,170
If you click on, get started, we see that we first of all,

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,210
need to install an extra tool, okay?

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,570
So let's do that.

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,240
Let's run this command on Linux and Mac iOS,

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,950
you might need to add pseudo in front of it,

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,780
on Windows You don't need to do that.

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,120
To run this command, and this will then install

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,920
extra tool provided by Firebase globally on your machine,

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,360
and we'll need that tool to then upload our project later.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,723
So let's wait for this installation to finish.

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,840
And once it is finished, we can go to that next step.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,813
Now we need to log in by running Firebase login.

29
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,760
So let's run this and this should open up a tab

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,300
in the browser and allow you to log in,

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,070
if you're not logged in already,

32
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,520
or it prompts you for password and your username,

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,510
your email address,

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,110
and you have to log in with those credentials,

35
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,310
which you used for logging in into your Firebase account

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,683
before as well.

37
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,140
Once that is done, you need to run Firebase in it.

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,750
So copy that command, and now in your project folder,

39
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,140
in your entire project folder, here,

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,303
you can run Firebase in it.

41
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,590
And this will ask you a couple of questions.

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,770
It asks you which part of Firebase you wanna manage

43
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,320
with this command line interface, where using at the moment.

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,000
And we really only want to use hosting here.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,640
So select hosting with the arrow keys,

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,223
and press space to market, and then enter.

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,030
Now, then you're prompted wherever you wanna host this

48
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,600
into an existing Firebase project or create a new one.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,650
As I said, you could create a new one,

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,433
but I will use an existing one.

51
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,400
And then it should list all the projects you have.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,960
And I'm simply picking that project

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,163
with which I worked early already.

54
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,540
Now we have the interesting part.

55
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,690
It asks us what our public directory should be.

56
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,980
And that's important because that's the directory

57
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,993
which holds the files that will actually be uploaded.

58
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,313
So here that would be the dist folder.

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,223
So we should enter dist here.

60
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,160
Once you entered dist, hit enter,

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,310
and you're asked whether this should be configured

62
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,310
as a single page app and rewrite all URLs to /index.html.

63
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,430
Now that can be confusing, why does this matter?

64
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,393
What's this about?

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,340
For a single page applications,

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,290
you have to be careful when it comes to routing

67
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,343
and hosting your app on a server.

68
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,590
When a user visits your webpage,

69
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,000
let's say it's hosted on a domain like "mypage.com,"

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,680
a so-called request is sent to the server.

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,100
Now let's say that request is not to your main domain,

72
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,100
but it's "mypage.com/products" or anything like that.

73
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,950
Now, as I just said, that request hits the server.

74
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,300
The server where your static web application,

75
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,533
your Vue single page application is hosted at.

76
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,220
Now, this server should actually ignore the path

77
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,810
that's part of the request,

78
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,390
because if it does not ignore it,

79
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,180
then the server will try to find something on the server

80
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,700
that matches this request.

81
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,700
For example, it looks for a product folder

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,500
in your hosted files and tries to find an HTML file

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,900
in such a products folder.

84
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,150
And for our app that would fail

85
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,850
because for our app, the folder structure we deploy is this.

86
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,260
We have just one HTML file.

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,283
In our app, for example, we have a /coach's route,

88
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,560
but we have no coaches folder here inside of this,

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,090
which is the content that will end up on a server though.

90
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,490
That's why we need to tell the server to ignore the path

91
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,700
and instead, always return the index.html file,

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,750
which then in turn contains the JavaScript code

93
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,750
off our application where then the Vue router can take over

94
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,010
and handle this path on the client side, so in the browser.

95
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,560
And that's really important, the Vue router

96
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,200
does not run on the server.

97
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,240
And therefore, it can only handle the path

98
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,180
which is in a URL, if the server ignores it.

99
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,980
That development server was already configured

100
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,300
to work like this,

101
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,240
which is why we didn't have to worry about that before.

102
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,410
But the web servers, real web servers,

103
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,023
typically do not ignore it by default.

104
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,700
And that's my Firebase is asking us here,

105
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,960
if we wanna configure this as a single page app.

106
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,940
If we choose yes here, which we should,

107
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,960
then Firebase will ignore all requests on the server

108
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,960
and as mentioned here, rewrite all URLs to index.html.

109
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,773
So that always index.html is served.

110
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,430
So let's choose yes here.

111
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,300
And now it's tells us that we already have a index.html file

112
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,560
in this, if it should override this

113
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,673
and here we wanna enter, no, because we wanna keep our file.

114
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,140
And now with that we initialized everything.

115
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,730
Now to really get deployed this,

116
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,710
there's just one change I wanna make.

117
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,750
In the public folder in index.html,

118
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,750
we can edit the index.html file before the project is built.

119
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,080
So any changes you want to make to your project,

120
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,640
to your HTML code, and here, for example,

121
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,480
should be made here, not in this.

122
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,420
You should never touch the code,

123
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,650
which is generated in a dist folder.

124
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,550
Instead, edit your input files and rebuilt the project,

125
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,180
if you wanna have a different output here.

126
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,160
And here, for example, I wanna edit the title.

127
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,110
It's actually using a placeholder here, in the end,

128
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,940
pulling in the title from somewhere else,

129
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,470
but we can delete this and overwrite this with Find a Coach,

130
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,250
for example, which is my title.

131
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,160
And now we could also add a meta tag

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,880
with a name of description

133
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,020
to then also add a description for search engines.

134
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,763
Like find a coach and grow as a developer.

135
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,280
And now with these final tweaks made,

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,660
I will run npn run build again so that these changes

137
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,740
are picked up and reflected in the dist folder,

138
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,273
which is now recreated.

139
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,700
And now we configured Firebase,

140
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,670
we have to final dist folder,

141
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,223
now we want to push the code onto Firebase.

142
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,170
And that's done if we follow the Firebase instructions

143
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,773
by now running Firebase deploy.

144
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,820
So now we do that, run Firebase deploy,

145
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,123
and this will now take our code and uploaded onto Firebase.

146
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
Now it shows us a progress here,

147
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,653
let's wait for this to finish.

148
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,530
And once it's, it also gives us the URL

149
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,430
where we can visit this app.

150
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,350
So I'm going to copy that open it here,

151
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,200
well, and here is the application which we built before

152
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,523
now running on their real web server.

153
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,130
Now I'd will be offline when you're viewing this,

154
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,880
but you can try it on your own with your own project.

155
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,920
And for anything else you wanna configure

156
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,363
like a custom domain or anything like that,

157
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,010
check out the Firebase console there

158
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,390
once you deploy your app under hosting,

159
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,370
you can see your app, you can add a custom domain

160
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,679
and you can do a bunch of different things here

161
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,283
to fine tune this to your requirements.

162
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,240
And that's it for deployment.

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,720
These are the steps and core concepts

164
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,640
you should keep in mind when you wanna deploy

165
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,683
Vue apps to a real server.
