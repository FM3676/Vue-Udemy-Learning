1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,780
Up to this point in this course,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,290
we always build projects locally.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,230
We tested them locally on an address

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,320
like localhost8080.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,330
We had our local development server running

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,920
in our projects to test the code we wrote

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,210
to see our application in action,

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,450
and that of course is totally normal.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,470
You're in development.

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,880
You do develop locally on your machine,

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,040
but of course ultimately your goal is not

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,170
to have your Vue application locally on your computer,

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,680
but you want to deploy it.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,050
You want to bring it onto other servers

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,630
and share it with other users.

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,800
And therefore this module will be about deploying

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,960
and optimizing Vue apps so that we can get

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,690
from development to production.

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,340
And you will learn what exactly deployment means

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,440
and which files you need to upload where

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,240
to share your Vue app.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,140
We will have a look at optimization techniques

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,150
or deployment steps you could say,

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,713
and we'll see all of that in action and a concrete example.
