1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,900
So how can we register routes now?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,070
while we get this routes array,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,070
and here we now pass JavaScript objects tutors array,

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,840
and every object represents one route,

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,100
and to configuration for that route.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,515
And here, one very important option,

7
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:22,770
which we need to set on every route,

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,120
is the path option.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,880
This tells the router for which path that's the part

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,350
of the URL after the domain,

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,580
a certain component should be loaded.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,413
For example,

13
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,210
that we want to load a certain component

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,540
for slash teams,

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,280
so that if our domain.com/teams is loaded,

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,790
a certain component is loaded.

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,000
And that's the second option we wanna set here.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,530
The component option,

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,790
here, we then define which components should be loaded,

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,990
by the view router when the user visits slash teams.

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,270
And in my case that would be the team's list component here.

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,540
Currently, I'm loading the team's list component here,

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,530
in app view with the dynamic component.

24
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,370
I got my navigation,

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,610
which emits a set page event,

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,740
that happens when either of the two buttons

27
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,080
is clicked in there.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,600
And then upon setting a page the active page,

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,830
data property changes either to team's list

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,650
or to users list.

31
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,960
And that are my two components here,

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,827
team's list and users list,

33
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:29,660
the two components which are all the registered here,

34
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,170
in my app component.

35
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,940
And that's simply den switches between these two components.

36
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,812
This is a way of doing it but it does not update

37
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:43,812
the URL and it's not shareable,

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,150
but it is the team's list component,

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,030
which I wanna load here for this route.

40
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,290
So, in this main JS file,

41
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,480
we now wanna import team's list,

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,230
from dot slash components, teams list dot view,

43
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,820
and then set component here equal to team's list telling

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,669
the view router that it's the team's list component.

45
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,763
That should be loaded if we visit slash teams.

46
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,490
And that's not the only route we wanna load.

47
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,490
Instead, I will duplicate this configuration here,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,670
to also register a slash users route.

49
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,160
And here we wanna load the users list component.

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,170
So therefore we now also import users list,

51
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,170
from components, users list dot view,

52
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,423
and load this for this slash users route.

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,250
And now we registered these two routes.

54
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,030
Now the routes are configured,

55
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,870
but a couple of things are missing to make this work.

56
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,430
For one at the moment,

57
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,540
does router is only stored in this router constant,

58
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,270
but we're not doing anything with constant.

59
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,700
We need to make our view app aware of this router,

60
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,350
which holds these routes.

61
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,600
We do this by going to our app,

62
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,200
and on this app, we have to use method.

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,640
This is a built in method,

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,510
which in the end allows us to connect our view app,

65
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,570
with a third party package,

66
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,700
with some other functionality.

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,570
And here we simply pass the router to use.

68
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,810
And this makes the view app aware of this router.

69
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,480
Now that's a first step,

70
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,200
but one important piece is still missing.

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,930
The view app is now aware of these routes,

72
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,890
thanks to view router and theoretically,

73
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,730
the view router sees,

74
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,810
that if we visit our domain slash teams,

75
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,333
we want to load this component,

76
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,470
but it's missing one important piece of information.

77
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,334
It doesn't know where to load

78
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:53,400
this component to.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,280
At the moment we're giving no hint at all to the router,

80
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,340
where does components should be rendered,

81
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,670
and thankfully it's not just taking the component,

82
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,580
and replacing everything on the screen with it.

83
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,070
Instead, we need to use a special component,

84
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,350
to let the view router know where to render it.

85
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,010
And we can replace this dynamic component

86
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,340
with that new special component,

87
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,290
since we're not going to use this dynamic approach anyways.

88
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,730
So instead here in app view,

89
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,050
let's say instead of this main element,

90
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,320
I want to render the selected route component.

91
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,730
And to let view router know about this,

92
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,440
we can use a number of component,

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,470
which is now built in, I'm saying now,

94
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,470
because it's built into view router,

95
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,790
and there for only a wadeble because we're using

96
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,710
the router in this view app.

97
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,640
But since we do that,

98
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,670
we now got a new built in component,

99
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,193
and that's the router view component.

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,570
And that's in the end of placeholder telling view router

101
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,430
that this is the place where to select it.

102
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,133
Routed to component, should be loaded.

103
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,100
And we can by the way now all to get rid

104
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,420
of these two imports here, team's list,

105
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,240
and user's list in app view and not registered

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,900
them as components anymore,

107
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,410
because we don't need to do that.

108
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,130
We're not using these components in our template,

109
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,960
by using dare selector.

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,690
Instead we select them here through the router.

111
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,790
And if you do that, if you load a component through routing,

112
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,350
you don't need to register this component.

113
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,050
Additionally, as a global or local component,

114
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,423
you don't need to do that.

115
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,880
So with that, we now let the router know,

116
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,250
where to load that.

117
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,490
And hence we can save everything and reload,

118
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,910
and we won't see anything on the screen,

119
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,490
because at the moment we're just

120
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,490
on our domain slash nothing.

121
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,460
Now the routes we registered were slashed teams,

122
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,070
and slash users.

123
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,920
So let's try those, let's enter ,

124
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,230
local host, 80, 80 slash teams,

125
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,270
and we see the team's page.

126
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,140
Let's try users, and we see the users page,

127
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,970
and now we got shareable links,

128
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,270
but of course our navigation isn't working anymore.

129
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,490
And the debt's definitely not what we want.

130
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,870
We want to make sure that we can still navigate

131
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,170
from inside the page,

132
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,500
and that we don't have to enter the difference

133
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,870
you ELLs manually, nobody uses webpages like that.

134
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,150
So let's see how we can navigate around with routes then.
