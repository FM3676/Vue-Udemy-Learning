1
00:00:01,613 --> 00:00:03,460
There are more things

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,030
you can configure when it comes to your routes

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,140
which you set up on your router.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,080
For example,

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,970
we have this pretty nice feature of nested routes.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,160
In some applications, you might want to have,

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,210
you can say a router inside of another router.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,910
Let me give you an example.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,840
Let's say our team members should not be loaded

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,310
on a new stand alone page,

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,960
but instead when I click view members here,

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,470
I want to load the members

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,440
for that team above the list of teams.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,060
So, on the same page I want to embed my members

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,970
of that team.

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,270
That's something which you might wanna do.

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,530
And that's something which is possible with the Vue Router.

18
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,390
We got this route here which is responsible

19
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,030
for loading our team members

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,380
and currently it's a stand alone route to find next

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,610
to the teams route basically on the root level

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,150
of all our routes.

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,890
These routes are all on the same level.

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,440
They're siblings to each other.

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,750
Now you can set up a nested route

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,090
by going to the route where you want to nest routes inside

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,893
and adding the children option on the route config.

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,520
Children takes an array

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,490
and it takes an array of routes.

30
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,480
So, the same routes we set up here in routes

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,650
are added to children.

32
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,600
So, here on teams we can now take this route

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,320
and move it in there

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,270
and now I reformatted this to make it a bit easier to read.

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,560
So, now inside of my teams route,

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,750
I have a child route which is this one.

37
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,000
And here you don't need to repeat the entire path.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,450
You can just add the segment

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,080
which should go after this segment.

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,860
So after slash teams.

41
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,000
And you can have more than one route in here.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,750
If you had multiple routes

43
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,610
that should be nested inside of teams

44
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,943
you could absolutely add them there.

45
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,000
Here I just needed one route though

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,270
but this route will now be reached

47
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,263
with teams slash and then some Id like t1.

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,990
And, now what's the difference

49
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,020
with having a nested route?

50
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,710
Well one difference is that if I save this,

51
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,560
if I click view members

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,750
now we don't load our team members route anymore.

53
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,300
And the reason for that is

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,330
that Vue, the Vue Router to be precise,

55
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,440
doesn't know anymore where to load this.

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,730
Because now the team members route,

57
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,850
this one here,

58
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,700
is no longer a root route.

59
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,280
It's no longer registered directly inside of routes.

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,603
It's a child route of another route.

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,180
Now the router-view component,

62
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,910
which we use is app view

63
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,880
is our top most router-view component

64
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,200
we have in this entire app

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,680
and it's only responsible for the root routes.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,500
So, for the routes directly registered

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,070
in the routes array.

68
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,010
So, this child route cannot be rendered

69
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,960
into this router-view.

70
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,500
Instead you now need to add a second Router Vue

71
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,730
in the component where this route

72
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,010
is defined as a child component.

73
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,720
So, in this case in our teams list component,

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,300
that's the real component

75
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,050
which has this as a child route.

76
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,080
So, it's the teams list opponent

77
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,650
where you now need to add an extra router-view

78
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,780
for all the child routes.

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,700
In this case for the one child route we got.

80
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,250
So, in teams list

81
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,600
above the unordered list for example,

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,173
we can now add another router-view.

83
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,570
And this router-view will now be important

84
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,330
for all the child routes

85
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,370
of the teams list component route.

86
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,190
So, of this route.

87
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,710
Hence, now if I go back to teams

88
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,350
and reload we see nothing because it's just slash teams

89
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,240
but if I click on view members,

90
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,890
now we see our members for that team.

91
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,670
If I change the team here

92
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,763
you'll see that updates up there.

93
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,230
And of course we can do this for all the teams.

94
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,130
And, that's another nice feature,

95
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,640
having these nested routes.

96
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
You will also notice

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,500
that with the nested route,

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,570
if my URL changes to that nested route

99
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,170
teams is still highlighted up there.

100
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,010
It wasn't before if you recognized that.

101
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,390
Before where this route

102
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,830
was a separate root route as a sibling to the teams route

103
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,160
before even though that route also started

104
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,790
with slash teams.

105
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,040
This link was not highlighted

106
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,470
because the active clauses only applied

107
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,300
if the currently loaded path

108
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,270
is actually related to the path this link points at.

109
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,650
And, this link points at slash teams,

110
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,720
slash teams t1, is now a nested route

111
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,950
on this teams route

112
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,180
and therefore whenever some nested route is active

113
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,660
this link is treated as active.

114
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,855
That's why now the active CSS class

115
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,250
is now being added here.

116
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,160
But that's just a extra side note, related to nested routes.

117
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,660
And nested routes can be a really useful feature

118
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,670
for building complex user interfaces

119
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,660
where you want to load different parts

120
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,190
maybe nested in different components

121
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,440
based on different URLs and paths.

122
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,513
And that's exactly what we're doing here.
