1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,680
Our TeamMembers component has one potential disadvantage.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,593
It's not only loadable through routing, why?

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,960
Because in the code,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,680
we rely on $route in the end,

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,020
we use it here in created and we watch it here.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,040
So if you would use this component by simply embedding it

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,320
in the template of another component,

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,220
let's say you change your application,

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,590
and you now suddenly want to use this differently,

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,580
or you use it in different places,

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,444
one time loaded through routing

12
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:37,890
another time used through its tag in the template,

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,440
then this would be problematic.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,580
It might be better if TeamMembers would be loaded such

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,210
that you get props

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,420
that you simply get your

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,373
teamId as a prop.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,530
That's how you would build this component,

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,820
if it would not be loaded through routing.

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,400
You would get the teamId through props

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,310
and in all the places where you need the Id,

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,370
instead of using this $route,

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,050
you use this teamId, referring to that prop

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,850
and here, you could then watch this

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,853
prop for a changes, for example.

26
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,040
And then we would get our newId here

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,247
would maybe forward that to LoadMembers.

28
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,210
And we will change the LoadMembers code here,

29
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,120
to not expect the route as argument but the teamId,

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,200
and therefore, we now just got teamId as an argument here,

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,363
and we can delete that old first line.

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,100
But if we save that it won't work,

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,490
we see nothing on the screen /t2

34
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,260
and if we open the developer tools,

35
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,730
we see that the problem is

36
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,710
that we cannot read the property 'members' of undefined.

37
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,190
And the reason should be obvious,

38
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,450
teamId is expected as a prop

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,450
but we're loading this through routing

40
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,080
and the router by default doesn't add

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,933
any props to this loaded component,

42
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,360
but that's something you can change.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,500
In your route config, here on this route,

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,320
which is the route responsible

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,570
for loading the TeamMembers component,

46
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,070
you can add another option,

47
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,310
you can add the props option and set this to true.

48
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,430
And this does one important thing,

49
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,430
it tells the view router that the dynamic parameters

50
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,650
should be passed into this component as props

51
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,523
rather than just on the $route property.

52
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,380
So now, you will have a prop off the name

53
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
you defined here after the colon,

54
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,990
in my case, teamId, the value which is now part of the URL

55
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,700
will now be passed in as a prop into this component

56
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,550
when it's loaded.

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,680
So with props true if you save that and reload now,

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,010
this works again.

59
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,210
And now we have one advantage,

60
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,210
now, this component TeamMembers is more reusable,

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,230
because now we can use it anywhere,

62
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,460
as long as we provide this prop,

63
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,723
it's not strictly tied to routing anymore.

64
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,310
So this is simply an alternative,

65
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,750
which you could consider when it comes to

66
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,160
routing and loading components through routing.

67
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,050
You can make your components more reusable

68
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,020
by using props instead of $route

69
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,750
and even if you don't plan

70
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,760
on using the component anywhere else?

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,970
You might prefer getting your data through props

72
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,010
than having to search for it

73
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,513
in the $route parents property.
