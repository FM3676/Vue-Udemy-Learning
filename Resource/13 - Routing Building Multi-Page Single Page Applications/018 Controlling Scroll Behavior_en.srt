1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,580
With all the knowledge we gained over the last lectures,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,620
we are nearing the end of this module now.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,840
You now know pretty much all the key features

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,560
you have to know about registering routes,

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,590
loading components and navigating.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,150
But there are two other nice features,

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,570
which can help you provide the user experience

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,880
you wanna provide.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,280
And that will be controlling the scroll behavior

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,960
of your pages and navigation guards.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,190
Let's start with controlling the scrolling behavior.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,800
What do I mean by that?

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,660
Well, let's say we're on the Teams page,

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,300
we load our team here and then I scroll down

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,470
so that I can load the Client Consulting team.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,220
If I click that, of course you component updates,

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,923
but I have to scroll up there to see that.

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,840
Maybe we want to scroll up there automatically,

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
when we switch the route here.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,740
That could be something we might wanna do,

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,490
in general, maybe.

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,920
Whenever we switch a route,

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,550
we wanna scroll to top so that the user always sees

24
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,330
the full new page and isn't stuck somewhere down the page.

25
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,190
And that's something we can add with the vue router.

26
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,220
In main js, where we create our router,

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,840
besides registering all those routes

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,740
and then setting some global conflict

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,800
like the link active class.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,330
You can also add a scroll behavior

31
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,173
property.

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,070
That scroll behavior property actually

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,130
is a method.

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,440
A method which will be called by the vue router,

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,653
whenever your page changes.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,170
And this stroll behavior method will then receive

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,290
free arguments, automatically.

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,310
A to,

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,380
a from

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,330
and a saved position

41
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,163
argument.

42
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:58,660
You can name them however you want,

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,830
but that is what will be in there.

44
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,393
But what is to from and saved position?

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,540
Let's simply

46
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,740
lock this.

47
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,840
Let's lock to,

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,860
from

49
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,263
and saved position,

50
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,960
and save this.

51
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,340
Now I reload

52
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,640
and I click

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,430
on a link here,

54
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,070
and you'll see I got this locked to the console,

55
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,170
actually we already got it when I first loaded this page.

56
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,070
Q and from in the end are route objects.

57
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,630
Q and from basically are what you also get with this route

58
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,370
inside of a component.

59
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,520
To and from,

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,580
are the pages we're going to

61
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,803
and we're coming from.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,660
When I first load this page,

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,940
the page we're going to is having this full path,

64
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,720
which this path without the query parameter and so on.

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,850
It has this params object, the query object,

66
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,710
and this is exactly the kind of object you would get

67
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,800
with this dollar signed route,

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,860
inside of the component that is loaded.

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,230
And we're coming from this path,

70
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,440
It's pretty much all empty because I just loaded the page.

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,020
If I cleared a console and I click a link,

72
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,460
you'll see this looks different.

73
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,985
Now we're going to this path,

74
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,370
with a parameter of t2,

75
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,823
and the route we're coming from has a parameter of t1.

76
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,353
And saved position is null here,

77
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:28,180
because saved position is only set,

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,340
if you're using the back button.

79
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,030
Then you see saved position is actually an object

80
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,700
with a left and a top property,

81
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,110
describing where the user scroll to,

82
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,960
when this page, you just went back to what's left.

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,793
For example,

84
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,260
if I scroll all the way down,

85
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,100
and they go to a different page,

86
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,660
and I go back,

87
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,960
then this

88
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,190
scroll

89
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,023
position,

90
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:56,890
which is saved here is the scroll position I had

91
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,453
when I left this page before I clicked the back button.

92
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,943
How can this all be useful?

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,450
This scroll behavior method should return

94
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,120
an object describing where the browser should scroll to,

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,670
up on the page change.

96
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,870
And here the object you return,

97
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,293
should have a left and the top property.

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,540
Just as the safe position has it,

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,870
when it is available.

100
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,470
And if you, for example, said left to zero,

101
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,010
and top to zero,

102
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,930
that means that you wanna scroll,

103
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,943
all the way to the top of the page.

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,350
If I always returned this,

105
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,990
and I've for the moment still console log to, from

106
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,840
and saved positions so that my IDE doesn't complain

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,310
about these being unused.

108
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,710
If I locked that,

109
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,960
but we always return this object,

110
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,050
the effect is, that if I scroll down

111
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,960
and switch to a different page,

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
we jump to the top

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,133
and that's exactly the behavior I want here.

114
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,010
Of course, on the other hand, if we go back,

115
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,760
I might want to go back down here

116
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,620
so that I really go back,

117
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,750
not just to the page we're coming from,

118
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,810
but also to the place on the page we were on.

119
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,630
And that's now where the saved position comes in handy

120
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,843
because that is saving the exact place we were scrolled to.

121
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,660
We can tweak this and check if saved position exists,

122
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,210
if it is not now, and if that's the case

123
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,860
we return to saved position.

124
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,360
So that for example, if we do go back,

125
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,220
we use the saved position instead of jumping to the top.

126
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,053
But if saved position does not exist, we do jump to the top.

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,430
And with that advice, save that and reload.

128
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,743
I can go to my teams,

129
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,220
load a team,

130
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,690
scroll down,

131
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,170
jump the top.

132
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,710
But if I now click back, I'm scroll down again.

133
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,420
And that can of course enhance the user experience

134
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,970
because now we scroll the user to the place

135
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,420
where he or she is able to see exactly the content,

136
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,053
that we wanna present at this moment.
