1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,540
Route parameters are useful,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,090
but they also can be tricky.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,660
There are various aspects

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,970
you should be aware of

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,420
which you might or might not want

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,460
to change or take care about.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,329
Here's one gotcha

8
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,100
Which you could face in an application.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,240
We don't face it here,

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,013
but I can add it so that we do face it.

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,820
Let's say on TeamMembers...

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,080
So on the component,

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,740
we load for this route with the parameter.

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,860
Let's say in there,

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,060
we actually,

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,980
for whatever reason,

17
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,883
have another router link,

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,417
which says,

19
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:40,647
"Go to...

20
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,260
"Team two,"

21
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,380
which always goes to slash teams,

22
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,620
slash T2,

23
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,320
which is the idea of the Team two.

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,430
Now this is a very constructed scenario,

25
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,010
but you could absolutely have an app

26
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,210
where on the page that was loaded for a given parameter,

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,460
you wanna go to the same page

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,910
with a different value for that parameter.

29
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,853
And that's what I'm trying to emulate or to simulate here.

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,213
So if I save this,

31
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,503
we got this,

32
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,810
"Go to Team two," link here.

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,850
Now, if we are on the page for team two,

34
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,600
of course, this does nothing.

35
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,740
But if we are on the page for Team one...

36
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh, this also does nothing.

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,610
And that's the gotcha I'm talking about.

38
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,800
If you are on the page

39
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,470
that was loaded for a dynamic parameter,

40
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,050
if you then wanna go to a different page,

41
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,790
say with a different value for this parameter,

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,260
which in the end of course is kind of the same page,

43
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,870
at least the same view component,

44
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,870
you face this problem here.

45
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,670
Now you should be aware that if I go to Team one,

46
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,640
we have T1 in the URL.

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,030
And if we then click this link,

48
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,550
this does change to T2.

49
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,120
But the date on the screen doesn't update.

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,203
Is this a bug?

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,410
Well, it's not a bug.

52
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,290
It's an intended behavior.

53
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,300
The view router does not destroy

54
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,590
and rebuild the components that were loaded

55
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,229
when you navigate around.

56
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,639
It's more efficient to cash them

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,070
than to always destroy and rebuild them

58
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,230
when the URL changes.

59
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,100
But that's the problem here.

60
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,510
I'm loading my data for the team members in created.

61
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,430
And this is called when this component is,

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,450
well, guess what,

63
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,050
created.

64
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,250
Now, as I just said,

65
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,080
the view router does not destroy and recreate the component

66
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,050
just because the URL changed.

67
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,270
Therefore, the code in created does not run again

68
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,883
when the URL changed.

69
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,770
Hence if you are on the page,

70
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,530
which you now want to load again,

71
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,050
but with different data,

72
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,660
with a different parameter.

73
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,493
By default,

74
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,253
the view router will do nothing.

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
That's of course not what we want here.

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,593
How can we react to this changed URL?

77
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,293
Well, in the end,

78
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:59,340
when the URL changes,

79
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,850
one other important thing changes.

80
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,820
This dollar sign route property.

81
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,070
It holds the latest information about the loaded route,

82
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,500
and it will update when the URL changes.

83
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,050
So this dollar sign route object

84
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,890
will always hold the latest parameter, for example.

85
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,380
And therefore,

86
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,010
you can add a watcher here,

87
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,193
and you can watch dollar sign route here.

88
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,580
So this built-in property,

89
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,570
you can watch that for changes.

90
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,000
And this watcher will now run

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,510
whenever to route changed.

92
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,600
So here you get the new value then,

93
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,970
the new route you could say.

94
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,343
And in here,

95
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,770
we can now run this logic again.

96
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,603
So therefore,

97
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,460
to not duplicate to code,

98
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,683
I will actually add methods here,

99
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,903
load TeamMembers,

100
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,530
and put my code in there,

101
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,950
and call load team members here,

102
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,446
in created manually,

103
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:07,373
and also call it here in my watcher.

104
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,500
So that I load this method and run this method,

105
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,010
which loads my TeamMembers

106
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,670
when the component is created,

107
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,463
but also when route changed.

108
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,000
Now, one thing I want to do here, though,

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,310
I wanna pass my new route

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,200
as our argument to load TeamMembers.

111
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,033
And here,

112
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:30,980
when we call it and create it,

113
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll pass this dollar sign route.

114
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,270
So I wanna pass the route object as our argument,

115
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,320
and add it the method a little bit,

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,010
so that we get our route object here,

117
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,293
and I will replace this route with just route.

118
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,710
It's not a must do,

119
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,740
but I wanna do it here

120
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,480
so that we get the route from outside,

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,450
so to say,

122
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,500
seen from inside this method

123
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,140
and we pass it as our argument

124
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,340
when we call the method.

125
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,563
With that,

126
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,960
if I save this and reload,

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,670
our links here on the Team's page still work.

128
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,500
But if I click on go to Team two,

129
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,330
now this page updates

130
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,930
because now we're watching changes on the route.

131
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,940
And this is just one way of making this work though.

132
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,450
It's a perfectly fine way,

133
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,770
but it's not the only way.

134
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,530
Because there is another problem you could face here,

135
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,090
or another thing about this TeamMembers component

136
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,480
you might not like.

137
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,723
Let's see what that is.
