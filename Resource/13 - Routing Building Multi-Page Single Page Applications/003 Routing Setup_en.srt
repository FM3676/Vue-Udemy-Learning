1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,300
To install this routing package

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,410
quits this running development server

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,890
by pressing control see here,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,890
and then run NPM install - - save, Vue-router.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,320
This is another package developed by the official vue team.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,120
So it's an official package,

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,770
which you can add to your Vue projects

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,563
to add this routing functionality.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,620
Now this will install this package

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,900
and once you're done installing it,

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,720
you can restart your development server with NPM run serve

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,853
but now we'll be able to add a routing to this application.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,680
And what does this mean add routing?

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,130
Well, now we can go to main JS

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,020
where we create our main Vue app this single app,

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,350
which we have here in the end.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,910
And on this app, we can now register this router,

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,360
which we just installed

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,210
and more importantly,

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,630
the routes we wanna have in this project.

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,462
So simply the different URLs we wanna support.

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,710
And to do that we need to import something

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,540
from Vue-router

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,500
so from this newly installed package

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,500
and that this something is a function create Router

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,460
so we have create app from Vue to create a Vue app.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,670
We have create router from Vue router to create a router

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,743
for such an app.

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,720
We can now create the router here for example,

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,650
simply by creating a new constant router,

31
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,680
sounds like a fitting name and calling create router

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,210
and storing the result of that call in this constant,

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,760
but create router needs some configuration

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,810
now it needs to know which different routes

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,800
so which different URLs we wanna support

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,160
and we can also set up more things.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,590
So for that, you pass a JavaScript object to create router

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,890
and in that object, we now got two important options,

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,180
which we can set the obvious important option is the

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,500
routes option.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,370
Here we register all the routes, the different paths,

42
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,850
the different URLs you could say which you wanna to support

43
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,900
this will be an array because typically

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,950
it's not just one route which you want to have in your app

45
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,560
if that would be the case, you don't need to router

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,650
so we'll have an array full of routes in here

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,580
and I will come back to this route conflict

48
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,793
in just a second,

49
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,510
but there also is another option which you should set.

50
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,030
And that's the history option.

51
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,816
Now that is basically telling the router

52
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:42,816
how to manage the routing history in this app

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,960
so when a user clicks somewhere goes to a different page,

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,080
then this new page is added to the browsing history

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,240
you could say and if the user then clicks a back button,

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,750
the history makes sure that well,

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,210
the router knows what the last page was.

58
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,550
And there are two different kinds of history

59
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,820
you could use here.

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,020
and we want to import another function from you router here

61
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,120
and that stick, create web history function,

62
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,340
which we then call here as a history option.

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,980
Now this might sound confusing,

64
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,810
but historically Java script in the browser,

65
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,810
wasn't always able to manipulate to browsers memory

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,780
on which page the user is on

67
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,500
and where the user came from.

68
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,410
Therefore, historically the router

69
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,910
had to emulate this behavior you could say,

70
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,580
and we didn't use the built in browser history,

71
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,060
but since a couple of years, does this no problem

72
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,690
and with create web history by calling this function,

73
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,830
we tell the router,

74
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,060
Hey, just use the browsers built in mechanism

75
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,570
for remembering where to user came from and so on.

76
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,840
And that's the end what we're telling the router here

77
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,143
use to build in browser support simple has that.

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,900
Now that's all we got to do related to that.

79
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,480
Now we can focus on those routes

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,750
because that's the heart of the router

81
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,110
here we'll be able to tell the router

82
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,100
which Vue component should be loaded

83
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,220
for which URL ,because ultimately that will be our goal.

84
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,339
We wanna to load the team's component,

85
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,470
let's say when we're on our domain slash teams

86
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,730
and we wanna load to the users component,

87
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,260
let's say when we are on our domain slash users,

88
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,483
so let's work on registering routes and loading them next.
