1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,670
Now, that's it for the Vue router.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,810
You learned why we need routing and how to set up routing,

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,880
you learned how to register routes,

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,350
that there is a lot you can configure there.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,840
You can set up re-directs, paths, names, metadata,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,240
multiple components that should be loaded,

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,600
nested routes with children.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,890
We learned how to work with dynamic path segments,

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,710
to use route parameters,

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,230
which we can extract in the loaded components,

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,251
how we can pass those route parameters as props

12
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,906
into the to-be-loaded components.

13
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:35,340
And, much more.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,610
We learned about all those navigation guards,

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,600
and about controlling the scroll behavior.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,330
We learned how to navigate with router-link

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,400
or also, programmatically

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,280
with the $router property and the push method.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,330
We learned how we can describe the location we want to

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,330
go to, for example, by setting up a string path

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,680
to which we want to go, or by passing such an object

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,770
using the name, adding params and possibly adding

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,380
a query parameter.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,360
With all of that, you can provide a great user experience,

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,390
you can make sure that users don't lose unsaved changes,

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,220
you can make sure that you have URL's

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,340
and paths in the URL's that relate to the content

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,020
that's visible on the screen,

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,350
and you got sharable URL's, which you can copy and paste

30
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,253
to load exactly that place off your Vue application,

31
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:36,993
even though it's still a single page application.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,800
These are all the things you learned here,

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,270
and I can absolutely recommend that you go through

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,050
this module again if some things aren't clear,

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,970
or maybe in a couple of weeks,

36
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,850
so that you make sure you don't forget all those things

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,080
which you learned here.

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,090
Because, you will need the Vue router in any bigger

39
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,120
application you are going to build.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,890
And, speaking of that, we are going to build

41
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,070
such a bigger application,

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,750
so that we can practice all the things we learned

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,009
thus far and also see the router in action,

44
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,402
in a more realistic application.
