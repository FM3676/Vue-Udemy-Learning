1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,120
Now let's use these special CSS classes,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,620
which are added by router-link to the created anchor tag.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,950
And for that here in TheNavigation.vue

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,570
I will actually add a new selector here

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,080
to this hover and active rule.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,110
And the that's anchor tag,

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,540
which has the router-link-active class on it.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,340
So a.router-link-active,

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,210
this tells CSS that I want to apply these styles

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,990
to every anchor tag, which has this CSS class on it.

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,163
And if I do that and saved this,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,840
you now notice Users is highlighted.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,870
If I click on Teams that stays highlighted,

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,870
and that's how you can reflect on your page visually

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,130
on your links, which link is currently active.

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,460
Now as a side note,

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,510
you have two classes on their router-link-active,

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,660
which I'm using for styling here,

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,000
but also router-link-exact-active.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,350
Now, the difference is that router-link-active

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,490
would also be applied to this item here.

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,920
If we had something like Teams, Team ID.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,150
So if we had some nested route to this route here,

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,480
now we have learned about nested routes yet,

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,860
so for in a moment, we can just ignore that.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,740
But the difference is that router-link-exact-active

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,210
will only be applied to the navigation item

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,770
that's fully matched by the current path.

29
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,530
Whereas router-link-active

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,980
will be applied to any navigation item,

31
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,260
which contains a part of the currently active route.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,220
At the moment, we have no situation

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,970
where we would have nested routes.

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,250
So at the moment it's either both or nothing,

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,733
but later we'll see the difference in action.

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,410
For the moment, it's just important

37
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,150
to be aware of these classes,

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,420
which helped you style your application.

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,650
You can also change those default classes

40
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,480
in case you're not happy with them

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,640
in main JS, where you create the router,

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,570
you got more config options,

43
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,490
and you've gotta linkActive

44
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,000
and a linkExactActiveClass option,

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,530
where you can use any other CSS class name

46
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,620
you might wanna use

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,720
instead of their router-link-active class,

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,330
which would be the default.

49
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,270
So if you want to go with just active, for example,

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,893
you could override this here.

51
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,420
And I'm doing that here so that we see it in action.

52
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,510
I'm setting the active class to just active.

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,950
And that means I need to change my styling here

54
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,453
and select the anchor tag with the active class on it.

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,950
And with that it still works.

56
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,420
And now you can tell it's the active class

57
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,960
besides the router-link-exact-active class

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,110
that's being added.

59
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,530
So you can configure things like that.

60
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,010
But with that, let's move on

61
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,680
and let's not focus too much on the styling here.

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,960
Instead, let's dig a bit deeper into the router

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,870
and learn more about the different options we have here

64
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,683
and the different kinds of routes we can register.
