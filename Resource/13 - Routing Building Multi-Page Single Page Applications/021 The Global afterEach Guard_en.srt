1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,460
Now, there is another

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,060
global guard we can add on the router

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,370
and that is the afterEach guard.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,690
This also wants a function,

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,090
and of course, as always here,

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,660
it doesn't matter how you define the function,

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,080
if you do it like this or as an arrow function,

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,980
and this also it gets the to and from argument,

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,490
but not the next function because afterEach

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,353
will only run once a navigation has been confirmed.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,100
So in here, you can't change that anymore.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,110
You can't deny a navigation.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,420
You can only do this in the before hooks,

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,860
in the before guards.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,830
The afterEach guard could be nice for sending analytics data

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,740
to your own server, for example,

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,010
to log every navigation action

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,650
and log when a user changes pages.

19
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,793
That's something you could do here.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,790
You don't use it to control what the user sees

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,310
on the screen because as I just said, it's too late here.

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,720
You can just console.log to and from

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,920
or send data to your server, as I said, but that's about it.

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,983
So here, I will console.log Global afterEach.

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,550
And if I do that and save this,

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,330
we see if I load that, Global afterEach

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,103
is the last thing we see on every navigation action.
