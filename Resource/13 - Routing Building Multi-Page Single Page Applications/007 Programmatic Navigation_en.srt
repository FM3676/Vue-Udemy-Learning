1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,830
I want to come back to this navigation here.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,440
We're currently using router link to have a way of

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,253
getting to different parts of our page here from inside

4
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,700
our app.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,860
So to have different links that lead to different pages.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,620
This is a very common way of navigating around.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,290
Sometimes, though, you also need to navigate

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,810
programmatically.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,390
Let's say for whatever reason on the user's list

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,870
page here, above this under list you had

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,010
a button, where I say confirm.

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,713
So this is a button, not a link.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,240
We see it here, now it's obviously totally unstalled

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,130
but it's good enough for what I want to show you.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,020
Let's say upon clicking this button

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,810
you want to run some code.

17
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,350
So we have a method here in our methods option,

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,490
confirm input, whatever.

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,520
Here you do something you store some data in

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,870
a variable, you send some data to a server.

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,320
You're doing something important.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,330
Once you're done with that, you want to change the page.

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,150
This is actually a common scenario that you want to navigate

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,100
away once some task finished.

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,810
Here it's just a dummy example but in bigger apps

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,930
you could have real use cases, where a form is submitted

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,220
and once it is submitted you want to navigate the user

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,410
away from there.

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,190
It's also something we'll see in action later

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,540
in the main course project.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,690
So here we don't want to use a link because

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,240
we don't just want to navigate away we

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,160
also want to do something else.

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,150
Hence we have a button, which triggers our confirm input

35
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,860
method here up on a click.

36
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,539
There we then do our important stuff but then at the end

37
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,533
we want to navigate away.

38
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,660
So we want to navigate away programmatically.

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,620
We don't have a link on the page which the user clicks

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,640
but we want to trigger the navigation

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,970
from inside the JavaScript code from inside

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,463
our component config object.

43
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,863
How can we do this?

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,540
Since we're using the router here on our view app

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,250
we have a special property available in our

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,240
component config objects.

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,980
We can access it through the this keyword, and

48
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,763
there we have dollar sign router available.

49
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,070
Dollar sign router is available

50
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,360
because we added the router package.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,963
On this router we now got various methods, which we can use.

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,870
For a navigating programmatically we, for example,

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,550
got the push method to push a

54
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,300
new route onto this routing history.

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,940
So simply to add a new route to this routing memory

56
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,233
the browser keeps.

57
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,340
Push in the simplest form

58
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,930
takes a string, which again, has just

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,100
the path in it to which you want to go.

60
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,453
So slash teams for example.

61
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,810
If I do that and save this and reload I can click confirm

62
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,980
and you see we go to slash teams then because of push.

63
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,030
Now there also are other methods on the router,

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,130
which you can access.

65
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,210
For example, you got back

66
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,470
or forward to basically

67
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,600
emulate the back and forward buttons in the browser.

68
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,450
You got more methods, which you of course,

69
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,890
can find in the official docs.

70
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,010
But here we need push for programmatic navigation.

71
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,800
So with that if you click this confirm button

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,160
we're taken to the Teams page programmatically

73
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,840
For any cases, where you have some code,

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,648
that should execute before you want to navigate;

75
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:57,040
programmatic navigation with the

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,433
dollar sign router is your friend.
