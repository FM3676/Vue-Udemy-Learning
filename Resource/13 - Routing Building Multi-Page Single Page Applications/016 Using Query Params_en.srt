1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:05,587
This object form of describing the location

2
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:07,850
or the destination of a link

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,840
can also be useful for other things,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,310
not just for using names and setting up a link

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,796
in a more convenient way instead of building a long string.

6
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:18,484
But also to maybe add extra information

7
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:19,687
which you might need.

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,890
Let's say you want to use a query parameter.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,550
In case you're not sure what that is,

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,930
a query parameter is the thing you see in some routes

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,040
and some URLs after the question mark.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,404
Like, sort equals ascending

13
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:37,440
A query parameter is basically an optional

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,990
route parameter which is not needed to find

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,386
and load a component, but which may be used

16
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:47,191
to then pass extra information into that component.

17
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:49,666
It's not a must use but it can be useful

18
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,469
in some Apps and some pages.

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,030
Now you could add such a query parameter.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,570
If you build your link manually

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,660
by simply adding it to your string

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,126
which you're building, like this.

23
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:07,766
But if you use this object form, it's even more convenient.

24
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:10,281
You can add a query property.

25
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:14,059
Next to name and parents to this config object

26
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:18,651
and query then takes a nested object, just as parents did.

27
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,650
And here you can add any query parameters

28
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,050
you might want to pass to the to be loaded page,

29
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,050
like sort with a value of asc a string saying asc.

30
00:01:30,502 --> 00:01:33,699
I'll reformat that to make it a bit easier to read.

31
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:37,010
And you can add any query parameters you want

32
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,041
and of course your page, your Component support.

33
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:44,930
These query parameters are not defined in the route config,

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,790
you don't need to add anything here

35
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,860
because they're optional by nature.

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,110
But now if I save that and reload.

37
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,270
If I click View Members you see that query parameter

38
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,730
is added to the URL automatically.

39
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,855
Now we're not doing anything with the parameter here,

40
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,682
but we are adding it.

41
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:07,810
And if you would want to use it in the component

42
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,630
that is loaded through that query parameter.

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,679
So in this case, team members, you can extract it

44
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:16,793
there you get access to your query parameters.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,173
If I console log it through this route dot query.

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,940
The query property holds information

47
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,880
about your query parameters.

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,960
So if I save that and reload and open the console,

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,630
we see we get an object here,

50
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,813
which has this sort key and the value of ascending.

51
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:40,228
So that's is how you get access to the query parameters,

52
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:44,203
you might be passing to a component through routing.

53
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,700
As a side note query parameters

54
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
are not provided as props.

55
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,594
If I log this dot sort here

56
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,950
hoping that you get a sword prop.

57
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,548
Since we have a source query parameter.

58
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:59,100
You will see that the value

59
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,076
I get here is actually undefined.

60
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:05,030
It's undefined because query parameters

61
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,335
are just accessible through dollar sign route.

62
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,790
There shouldn't be a problem though,

63
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,060
because query parameters are optional anyways.

64
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,921
So if you ever use your component in a different way,

65
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,599
so not by routing but by embedding it

66
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,532
in a number of components template.

67
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:25,365
You might simply not have access to the query parameter,

68
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:27,281
but since it is optional anyways,

69
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:30,020
and it might not be added to the URL as well.

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,930
Your code should be prepared to handle

71
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,899
the non existence of this query parameter anyways.

72
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:41,130
But that's it for query parameters here,

73
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,610
I wanted to bring it up, because it is important

74
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,457
to be able to work with those as well.

75
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,950
It is important to know that view router

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,943
makes adding and extracting them easy.

77
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:53,648
We don't need them for this dummy application,

78
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:57,493
but you might need them for our applications of course.
