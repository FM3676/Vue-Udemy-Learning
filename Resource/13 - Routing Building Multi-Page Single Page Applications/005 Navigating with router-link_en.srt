1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:04,320
(Narrator)So now with our routes registered,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,470
let's make sure we can also reach those routes

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,960
from inside our application.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,610
And we got this that navigation.vue file

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,550
where I got two buttons,

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,420
where I emit a custom event

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,730
to which I previously listened to hear in an app view.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,120
I'm still listening to it.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,400
But actually, now we're not going to navigate like this,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,570
we now don't need to manage manually

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,800
which page should be loaded,

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,830
we can get rid of the active page data property in app view,

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,870
we can get rid of this event listener here

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,510
on then navigation, and therefore we can also get rid

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,410
of this set active page method here of course,

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,403
we can get rid of the entire methods block therefore.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,520
In the navigation we no longer emit set page

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,420
and we therefore no longer have to set active page method

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,970
and we can hence get rid of the entire methods here.

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,254
And therefore actually, we can get rid of

21
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:04,099
of the entire script block since

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,750
we got no specific component configuration in there anyways

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,710
Instead, we'll now navigate differently

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,700
and will not use a button anymore,

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,846
instead we will use another built-in component that comes

26
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:19,400
with the view router.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,710
And that is the router link component.

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,720
It's a little bit like the built-in anchor tag,

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,920
HTML element, you could say,

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,330
but it's a special anchor tag,

31
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,680
A special anchor tag,

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,010
which actually will not load a different page

33
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,005
and reload the entire app,

34
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,630
and hence loose the current state.

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,280
But instead a special anchor tag where the browser default

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,720
of loading a different page is prevented.

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,300
and instead, the view router takes over,

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,717
analyzes the link the user clicked

39
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:54,410
and that downloads the appropriate component

40
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,443
and updates the URL.

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,660
Things like that are handled by router link.

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,440
You can still pass your text between there,

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,305
you can actually pass any HTML element in there,

44
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:08,009
which you might need because

45
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,850
router link internally uses slots.

46
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,240
But here I just want some text.

47
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,430
And now of course, we need to configure router link.

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,460
And the most important configuration here is the to prop,

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,010
which it expects.

50
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,490
The to prop takes various different values.

51
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,950
and the simple way of using it is to provide a string to it

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,110
which holds the path you want to go to.

53
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,040
So in this case, slash teams.

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,200
So of course, that should be one of the routes

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,423
you are supporting in your routes configuration.

56
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,080
And that's already all then

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,470
we can also replace the second button

58
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,980
with such a router link.

59
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,260
Here, I want to go to my users,

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,863
and hence the two probe points at users.

61
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,830
Now we'll get some problems with styling here

62
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,530
because previously I used a button

63
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,337
now it's a Link hence I will replace the

64
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:05,760
button CSS selector down there with an anchor tag,

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,170
because router link under the hood will render

66
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,683
an anchor tag so we can style an anchor tag here,

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,190
and I'll delete this font CSS property.

68
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,840
Keep the rest though,

69
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,990
and also replace button hover and button active

70
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,610
with an anchor tag,also add a new CSS property

71
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,213
to the anchor tag rule here and set text decoration to none.

72
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,680
With that styling updated, if we save this and reload,

73
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,210
we get the same buttons as before,

74
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,280
but now these are actually links

75
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,800
and if we click them,

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,000
we switch between these different routes.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,040
And if we inspect these elements,

78
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,060
we see what I just explained in theory.

79
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,980
We got anchor tax here,

80
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,290
which has href attribute but

81
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,370
this router link component actually makes sure that,

82
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,430
the browser default is prevented,

83
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,540
and the browser doesn't really try

84
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,320
to load a different HTML file.

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,980
But instead, the router then analyzes

86
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,150
the value in the ref attribute

87
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,220
and checks your routing config

88
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,579
to find the appropriate view component

89
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,680
that should be loaded.

90
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,280
In addition, you see that some CSS classes were added here,

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,940
router link active and router link exact active.

92
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,830
And we only have this on teams at the moment.

93
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,219
If I inspect the upper list item,

94
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,770
we don't have the classes there.

95
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,320
These classes are added automatically by view router

96
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,710
on the link which is currently selected.

97
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,010
So for the route that's currently active,

98
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,070
so that you can actually style these links based

99
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,200
on the selection to give the user a feedback

100
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,380
regarding the route he or she is currently on.

101
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,610
Now, that's something we're going

102
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,803
to explore next.
