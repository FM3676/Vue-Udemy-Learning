00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,460
In this module,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,810
we're going to explore routing

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,570
and I will explain what exactly routing is

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,410
and why we need it.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,010
We'll have a look at how routing

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,670
can make our Vue app better

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,240
and actually helps us build a totally different

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,850
kind of Vue app, you could say.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,230
You will therefore learn what

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,800
and why routing is, but you will then of course

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,800
all learn how to set up the Vue router and routes with it.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,380
And we'll then explore how to navigate around

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,110
with routing, how to configure routing,

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,713
and which different options you have there.
