1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,040
Now we know all the core

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,820
and even some advanced features which you need to know

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,780
about the Vue Router and about routing.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,360
And we saw all those important features

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,960
in action in this demo project.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,430
Now we're going to build a bigger project in the next module

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,580
where all of that makes even a bit more sense

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,590
since we'll then have a more realistic project.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,580
Before we go there though,

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,580
let's talk about organizing our different files and folders,

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,610
because at the moment I'm working with the components folder

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,570
with my different feature areas

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,400
and then the different components, nothing wrong with that.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,750
But when you use routing, you could also argue

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,990
that you don't just want to have components,

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,470
but maybe also a pages or a screens folder.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,670
And I'll go with pages.

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,760
This is optional.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,980
You don't need that,

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,460
but you could then put the components

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,520
which are loaded as pages through your router

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,680
into the pages folder to have a clear distinction

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,700
between the components which are loaded through the router,

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,560
and the regular components,

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,870
which you embed in your templates.

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,210
Maybe you don't want this distinction.

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,320
For team members, we for example ensured

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,430
that route parents are passed in as prompts.

29
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,040
So maybe that should be usable

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,770
as a regular component as well,

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,170
but maybe you do want this distinction.

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,590
And then, of course, we could move Users List Vue

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,520
and Teams List Vue,

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,520
and also the Not Found page over into the pages folder,

35
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,630
and also adds to Users Footer and the Teams Footer diary.

36
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,620
And it's up to you,

37
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,463
whether you also want to use Team Members or not.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,410
Now we just need to update all the imports

39
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,863
and import team's list from pages/TeamsList,

40
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:06,070
users list from pages/UsersList and so on.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,030
Do that for all those pages.

42
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,380
And again, this is really optional,

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,350
but it can make sense especially in bigger apps,

44
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,330
since it makes it easier to see

45
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,540
which components will be loaded as pages through the router

46
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,680
and which components will be used as components

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,153
that are embedded into other components templates.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,380
Now, with that you don't just need to update all the imports

49
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,240
in the main JS file, of course,

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,150
but also any imports you have

51
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,500
inside all of your page components,

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,300
because here the POS are now incorrect.

53
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,080
We need to go up one level with two dots and a slash,

54
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,250
then go into the Components folder

55
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,250
and then here into Users, UserItem.vue for teams list.

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,020
I also need to update teams item,

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,130
which I get from components.

58
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,690
So going up on level of components, teams,

59
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,793
and TeamsTtem.vue.

60
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,150
And with that that re-compiles and works as before,

61
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,240
but now the pages are organized in a separate folder.

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,070
Again, it's up to you whether you want this,

63
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,270
but I want to show this possible way

64
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,993
of organizing components.

65
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,560
Now related to reorganizing our files and folders,

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,340
you might notice that the main JS file gets rather big

67
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,320
with all our routes in here.

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,370
Now this is of course a small app but even with that,

69
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,710
all the routing logic takes up quite a bit of space in here.

70
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,810
Now this is not bad per se,

71
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,900
but it makes it harder to find the place

72
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,110
where you actually create your app and so on.

73
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,120
Hence you might wanna use a separate router JS file

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,290
and actually move all the routing related code

75
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,650
into that file.

76
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,310
So grab all that code here and move it into router JS,

77
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,543
except for the app Import.

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,690
And in main JS now get rid of all those other imports

79
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,500
and then take the router

80
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,400
and all the routing logic catted from main JS

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,290
and added here in router JS.

82
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,839
And then at the very bottom, export to router as a default

83
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,800
so that we can import it into another file,

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,040
because we need to import it into main JS now.

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,913
We can import a router from ./outer.js,

86
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,130
and then we can still use router because we're importing it.

87
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,913
But with that, everything will work as before,

88
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:42,600
but our routing code is now in a separate file

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,890
and that makes our code overall

90
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,333
more manageable and maintainable.
