00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,320
Here's another feature

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,200
which can be useful,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,740
especially used in conjunction with

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,610
navigation guards.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,770
And that would be a Route Meta Fields.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,450
On any given route in your route config,

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,320
you could add a extra property,

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,650
the meta property.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,210
Meta takes any kind of value,

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,090
for example an object,

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,570
and you can store any kind of values in there.

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,693
For example,

13
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:31,870
needsAuth set to true,

14
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,100
but this is entirely up to you.

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,990
Why could this be useful?

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,360
Well, you can access this meta field in all the places

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,970
where the route object,

18
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,040
the dollar sign route object is available.

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,130
And that's the case inside of components

20
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,500
and with that you could pass data

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,480
into a component which is loaded for this route,

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,950
but you can also use it in your navigation guards

23
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,110
because there you also got access to the

24
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,860
to and from route objects.

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,050
And you could then for example add meta

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,620
like this to indicate that this route

27
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,630
needs authentication,

28
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,160
to then go to the Global beforeEach route

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,310
and check if the route you're going to

30
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,653
in it's meta field needsAuth, if that's truthy.

31
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,300
And then here you could check whether

32
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,920
the user is authenticated.

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,270
For the moment I'll just log Needs auth!,

34
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,560
but here you could then check

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,750
whether a user is authenticated

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,700
and if that is the case, you confirm this

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,050
and otherwise you deny this.

38
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,260
With that you could use a global navigation guard

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,340
that runs for every route, to then

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,520
still do different things based on the meta data

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,563
attached to the different routes.

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,980
And that is something which also

43
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,210
can be useful to elegantly setup

44
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,620
a global navigation guard that still

45
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,510
does different things based on

46
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,193
the meta data you attached to a route.

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,430
It's an advanced concept you'll definitely

48
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,900
not need it all the time, but having

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,170
this extra data which you can pass

50
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,900
into a component and into this route object

51
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,830
more importantly when a certain route is matched,

52
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,823
can be useful at times.
