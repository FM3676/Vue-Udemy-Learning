1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,140
Now we don't just have

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,650
this Global guard though.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,773
This beforeEach function here will run

4
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:11,840
on every navigation action,

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,507
no matter which route is being used,

6
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:18,170
no matter from which route we go to which other route,

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,127
this will always run.

8
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,812
Sometimes this is what you need, sometimes it's not,

9
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:26,645
sometimes you just wanna protect individual routes.

10
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:28,070
You could do this, of course,

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,490
with a if check here, where you check your to

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,711
and from route objects,

13
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:35,229
to also run different logic based on different routes.

14
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:39,610
But you can also set up the beforeEach navigation guard

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,420
on single routes.

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,970
For example, on users, let's say.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,630
For that you simply go to your users route conflict,

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,161
and here you can add beforeEnter, not beforeEach,

19
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:54,833
because now it technically is just one route.

20
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,496
BeforeEnter is a method here as well.

21
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:02,233
And just as beforeEach, it gets to, from and next.

22
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:08,040
So here I console.log('users beforeEnter')

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,792
and maybe also console.log(to, from) is you want to

24
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:15,157
and then call next to confirm it

25
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:18,090
or do whatever you wanna do with next.

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,239
Next works just as I explained it

27
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,443
on the Global beforeEach navigation guard.

28
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:28,310
Here I'm just confirming every navigation to users.

29
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,938
And now this will be called whenever we go to users.

30
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:35,803
So if I saved that and reload.

31
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,979
If I go to users, we see Global beforeEach,

32
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,933
because that still executes.

33
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:45,763
After all it executes for every navigation action.

34
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:48,066
But we also see users beforeEnter

35
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,510
and then the output of to and from for this page.

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,663
To of course, is pointing at the users page,

37
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:56,613
because that beforeEnter hook was registered

38
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,293
for the users page.

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,414
Now, in case you don't wanna register

40
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:05,730
this on the route level or in your route conflict,

41
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,191
you can also add a new hook,

42
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,910
a new method inside of your component.

43
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,840
Let's say in the users list component.

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,380
Here in your component conflict object,

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,497
you can add all those view lifecycle methods,

46
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:22,553
like created or mounted and you can also add

47
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:26,246
the beforeRouteEnter method.

48
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,697
If you use the view router, which we do,

49
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:31,915
this will be called before navigation

50
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:35,108
to this component is confirmed.

51
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:40,108
And here again, you get to, from and next,

52
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,400
and therefore we can do what he did before.

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,207
We can console.log('usersList Cmp beforeRouteEnter').

54
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:54,759
We can then console.log(to, from) of course

55
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,463
and we can call next or run any logic we wanna run

56
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:03,463
to confirm or deny navigation to next or redirect the user.

57
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,860
And with that, if I go to Teams,

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,534
reload, clear the console and go to users,

59
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:14,705
we see Global beforeEach and then to and from,

60
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:17,473
users beforeEnter and then to and from,

61
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:21,020
and then UsersList Cmp beforeRouteEnter.

62
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,853
And that's the order

63
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,603
in which these navigation guards execute.

64
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:29,056
Global is always first, then the route conflict level

65
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:31,223
and then the component level.

66
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,036
All of these hooks run before the route is confirmed though,

67
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:40,220
which is why you can and have to call next

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,950
to confirm it manually or deny it

69
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,373
or redirect the user somewhere else.

70
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,501
We've got two other guards related to loading a component.

71
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,277
One is the before route update guard,

72
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:56,482
which you call directly inside of a component.

73
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:59,957
To be precise, inside of components which are reused,

74
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:03,120
which in our case would be the team members component.

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,293
Here we got the parameter, the team ID parameter,

76
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:10,068
and it's absolutely possible that we are on the page

77
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,059
of one team and we load another team members page.

78
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:17,779
And then this team members page never leaves the screen

79
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,430
and hence is reused, as you learned.

80
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,629
In such cases, view router will call another nice method

81
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:26,880
in the component conflict object.

82
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,178
Maybe here next to created,

83
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:33,889
there you can add the beforeRouteUpdate method

84
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,683
and view will call this method whenever this component

85
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:43,116
is about to be reused with new data,

86
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,802
because the route changed.

87
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:48,317
So here we also get to, from and next,

88
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:53,223
and then you can also deny or confirm the navigation

89
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,994
just as you know it, just as I explained it before

90
00:04:55,994 --> 00:05:00,330
on the Global beforeEach hook, it's the same here.

91
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,927
And besides that of course,

92
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:06,927
you can utilize to and from, for example,

93
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:13,281
to call loadTeamMembers based on the new team ID param,

94
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:20,648
which you get on the, to be navigated to route object.

95
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:24,360
Now of course, we already have logic in place here

96
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,105
to handle the changing team ID route parameter

97
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:30,732
in this component, so we don't need beforeRouteUpdate

98
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:33,558
for that, but using beforeRouteUpdate

99
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:36,243
would be an alternative to watching

100
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:38,441
the team ID prop, for example.

101
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,850
Though of course, with that hook,

102
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,720
we again bind this component to be used with routing.

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,057
We use props instead of route params

104
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,650
to make this component more flexible.

105
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,018
When we use this alternative,

106
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,220
we would make it less flexible,

107
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,168
because this is only called if this component is loaded

108
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:00,871
and reloaded through routing of course.

109
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:03,941
But now this would be an alternative and with that

110
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:06,867
we can console.log('TeamMembers Cmp beforeRouteUpdate') here

111
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:17,530
and console.log(to, from) if you want to,

112
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,697
and then save everything.

113
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,980
And now if I go to a different team,

114
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,639
we see beforeRouteUpdate runs and well,

115
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,671
then our logic in there runs, which we don't need here,

116
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:32,554
but I want to show you this hook of course.

117
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm going to comment this out though,

118
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,617
because we are already loading team members

119
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:40,510
when the team ID changes, we don't need to do this twice.

120
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,996
But that is another navigation guard

121
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:45,796
or another navigation hook you could also call it,

122
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,453
that is worth knowing.
