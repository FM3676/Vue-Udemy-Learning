1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,969
And for that, we should go to this

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,210
teams list component, and there we see

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,380
it's the teams item which is being rendered,

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,570
which holds this button, which turns out to be a link,

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,870
and this link currently is a regular anchor tag,

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,323
and I instead want to use what?

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,400
A router link, that reaches to this route,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,180
but of course where the ID of the team is different

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,930
for every different team item.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,250
So, we're going to replace the anchor tag

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,103
with router link here,

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,753
like this,

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,463
and now set the two property to what.

14
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:45,980
Previously it was just slash teams, but now it needs to be

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,660
slash teams, and then the ID, but the ID is different

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,463
for every teams item.

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,210
Well, first of all, we should get the ID as a prop here.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,770
I will add ID as a prop, so that we have it available

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,640
instead of the team's item component,

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,140
because without having the ID of a team, it will be hard

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,303
to construct the correct link here.

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,690
So in teams list where I loop for my teams items,

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,360
I will actually bind ID to "team.id"

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,480
so that we have the ID available

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,333
in this teams item component.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,320
But with that, we still need to build this link.

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,070
And we can do this, because two does not just have to

28
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,140
be set like this, you can also bind it to a dynamic value,

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,860
with the bind, or the shorthand, ":to".

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,470
And now this points at a JavaScript expression,

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,590
or simply at a data property, whatever you have,

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,410
and here we could then derive the full path

33
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,670
you wanna go to, by combining slash teams

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,440
which is a string here, with single quotes,

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,400
since this is now a JavaScript expression,

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,800
slash, and then plus ID.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,090
This constructs this URL, this path,

38
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,960
where ID is different for every usage of teams item.

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,143
So for every usage of this component.

40
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,160
And hence, if I now save this and we reload,

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,110
we get different links here,

42
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,640
which lead us to the different team members.

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,373
So, that is working.

44
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,970
And of course, we could now also take this, and outsource it

45
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,660
from inside our template here,

46
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,030
into a computed property, to have less logic in a template,

47
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,270
and have our team members link computed property,

48
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,960
for example, where we return

49
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,080
this generated URL, and then here

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,663
we point at team members link.

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,823
That of course is 100% optional.

52
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,563
So with that, if I reload, this still works.
