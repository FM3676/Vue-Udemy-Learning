1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,130
Now for the moment,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,630
that's it when it comes to navigating around

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,310
and building those two values

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,130
like that object here with the query parameter.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,240
I now wanna move on to another feature,

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,080
which can be useful in some applications.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,453
And that would be multiple router views on the same level.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,900
We already have multiple router views in this demo app.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,780
We have one in App vue

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,660
and we have one in the team's list component

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,761
for the nested routes that belong to the route

12
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:35,323
that loads the team's list component.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,530
But you can also have

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,330
multiple router views on the same level.

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,850
So for the same set of routes,

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,003
for example, here in App vue,

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,440
we could have a footer element let's see,

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,920
but that's not mandatory.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,080
But in there we could have another router view.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,400
Now, of course, having two router views on the same level,

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,640
which are there for dealing with the same routes

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,790
will not be too helpful just like that.

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,690
If I saved that

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,523
and I reload,

25
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:11,170
we now just see that every page has loaded twice.

26
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,820
Of course, because we have two router views.

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,543
That's probably not the behavior you want.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,420
But instead multiple router views on the same level,

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,690
allow you to add another cool functionality.

30
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,240
You can load multiple components per routes,

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,060
and then sent them to different router views.

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,600
Now for that let's say,

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,430
we have a TeamsFooter.vue component,

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,290
which has a simple template where it say Teams Footer,

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,123
just so that we can recognize it.

36
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,290
And then I copied that to the users folder,

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,983
but name it UsersFooter.

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,653
And in there, it should, of course say users footer.

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,850
Now in reality, you would have more in there than just text.

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,180
But the main thing is that you have two different components

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,050
that should be loaded as a footer,

42
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,470
depending on whether you're in the teams area

43
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,783
or the users area of pages.

44
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,100
And that could absolutely be a requirement

45
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,390
you have in your app.

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,480
With the view router,

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,530
that's easy to implement.

48
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,400
In your route config,

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,365
you can register more than one component per route.

50
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:22,780
Here, for example, on teams,

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,930
instead of just having one component here,

52
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,683
we can add components.

53
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,670
So plural. And this now takes an object.

54
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,290
And in this object,

55
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,800
you can now define key value piers where the keys

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,150
identify different router views,

57
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,150
and the values are the components

58
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,040
that should be loaded into this router view.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,742
And that now works if you give those router views names,

60
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:54,260
just as you can give names to slots.

61
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,920
We could give this router view in the footer,

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,843
a name of footer, but the name is up to you.

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,130
We could also give this router view a name,

64
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,830
but just as we have slots,

65
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,110
you are allowed to have one unnamed router view

66
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,250
on the same level,

67
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,403
which will then be the default router view.

68
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,100
So now you're back in our route config.

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,760
We can add a key off default

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,930
to point at this unnamed router view

71
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,120
and set up the component that should go into that default,

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,920
which in this case is the TeamsList.

73
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:32,260
But we can then also add a footer key here

74
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,840
pointing at that router view named footer

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,210
and set up the component

76
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,980
that should be rendered in this router view.

77
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,010
And that's a component I have yet to import.

78
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,420
That will be the teams footer component,

79
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,253
which is imported

80
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:51,863
from components/teams/TeamsFooter.vue.

81
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,710
And when we're already importing stuff,

82
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,663
I can also already import UsersFooter

83
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:59,563
from components/users/UsersFooter.vue.

84
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,550
And now it's the team's footer,

85
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,690
which I wanna set as a value for the footer outlet

86
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,113
on my components here.

87
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,900
Now I don't need to change anything

88
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,140
about the nested child route here.

89
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,800
Here I still only wanna load one component,

90
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,320
but the parent has more than one component here,

91
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,283
as you can tell.

92
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,550
Now we can also do the same here for the users.

93
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,200
On the users route, instead of using component,

94
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,410
we could use components,

95
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,000
set the default to UsersList

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,723
and the footer outlet to UserFooter, UsersFooter, sorry.

97
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,660
So now we're using these named router views

98
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,200
for users and teams.

99
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,080
And for all the routes like this catch all route

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,960
where we just have one component,

101
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,350
that one component

102
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,070
will always go into the default unnamed router view.

103
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,060
So we don't need to set up components here

104
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,323
if we only have one router view we wanna support here.

105
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,470
With that, whoever we can save that.

106
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,840
And now you'll see our team items, our teams,

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,720
and then the teams footer for a user.

108
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,840
You see the users footer and the users, of course.

109
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,470
If I select a team, we see the team members

110
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,730
and then still

111
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,920
are two different teams components down there.

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,630
And if I enter anything invalid,

113
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,260
we still just see one not found route,

114
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,360
because as I said,

115
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,563
that then goes into the default unnamed router view.

116
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,050
So named router views can be helpful

117
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,210
to allow you to construct more complex user interfaces

118
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,710
where you wanna load more than one component

119
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,150
for a given path.

120
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,880
For example, to not just have flexible main pages,

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,963
but all the flexible footers.
