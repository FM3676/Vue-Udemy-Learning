1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,490
Now these are the guards related to

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,810
coming to a page,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,700
which are called before and navigation action is confirmed.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,340
There also is a useful guard,

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,700
which is triggered when the user wants to leave a page.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,630
Of course, when you leave a page and go to a number of page,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,800
all "the before guards" are triggered,

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
but maybe you also want to run some code on the component

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,030
that is being left right before it's being left.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,157
And you possibly want to be able to deny

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:36,197
"the leave this page actioned here."

12
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:37,593
But what do I mean by that?

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,650
Let's say on the user's list component,

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,860
we wanna run code whenever this component is left.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,120
We could do this

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,830
with the unmounted lifecycle hook vue knows.

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,860
If I locked this here,

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,713
this will be executed whenever we leave the user's page.

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,690
So if I go to users and I leave to teams,

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,990
you see unmounted here.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,950
But the problem is that this runs after the hooks,

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,470
so after the navigation has been confirmed,

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,220
and this gives us no way of canceling the navigation.

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,840
Now why might we want to cancel the navigation

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,400
from inside the component which we're leaving?

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,170
Well, let's say you had a form in there,

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,170
and you wanna make sure that until that form has been saved,

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,050
you at least wanna warn the user,

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,770
that there are unsaved changes,

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,220
which would be lost if the page is left.

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,070
And we can simulate this with a number button here,

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,780
save changes and a new data property,

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,273
so for that I'm adding data to this user's list component,

34
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,940
and there I have to change as saved property

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,200
which initially is false.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,260
And that's of course, just some dummy code here.

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,880
Then we could have a method saved changes,

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,783
and then here I set this changes saved to true,

39
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,039
and save changes should be triggered

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,560
when this button here is clicked.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,540
So let's bind it to that.

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,850
Again, this is all just some dummy code,

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,093
just a small example.

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,620
Now we wanna make sure that as long as this is false,

45
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,220
we at least get a warning

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,673
that we don't accidentally leave the page,

47
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,430
because we all know that you are on that page,

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,190
you're entering something in a form

49
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,110
and accidentally we swipe to the right

50
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,180
and all the input is lost,

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,190
or we accidentally hit the back button on our mouse.

52
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,400
So accidentally leaving a page

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,210
where you entered something in a form

54
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,473
is definitely something we all know.

55
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,780
And that's exactly where another navigation guard

56
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,220
can help us.

57
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,130
Inside of a component in the component convict object,

58
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,057
you can add "the before route leave guard."

59
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,130
You can add this if you're using the vue router,

60
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,930
and then the router will call this first

61
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,700
before calling all "the before each

62
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,507
and before enter guards."

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,590
Now here, you also get to, from and next,

64
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,200
just as on the enter guards,

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,450
but this will now be called first.

66
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,900
And here we can of course,

67
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,900
console log, users list component before route leave.

68
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,620
And of course, we can also console log to and from

69
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,200
to see what's inside of these route objects.

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,660
But most importantly, we can now use next as you learned it,

71
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,420
to confirm the navigation or to only sometimes confirm it.

72
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,880
For example we can check if this changes saved is true.

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,410
If that's the case, I wanna call next,

74
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,390
because if the changes are saved,

75
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,130
the user may just leave the page.

76
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,880
But if that's not the case,

77
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,680
I want to ask the user,

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,670
wherever he or she really wants to leave.

79
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,630
For that here an else,

80
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,320
we can call the prompt function,

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,780
which is built into the browser,

82
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,529
which shows a built in alert,

83
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,310
where the user has to choose yes or no.

84
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,572
Are you sure?

85
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,210
You got unsaved changes?

86
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,210
Is something we could ask here.

87
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,680
The result of that is a bullion,

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,110
which we could store in a user wants to leave constant.

89
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,310
And then we call next and pass user wants to leave to that.

90
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,410
And that's either true or false

91
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,960
based on what the user chose

92
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,800
and this alert will present to him or her.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,990
And if we pass true to next,

94
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,080
that's just like calling next like this,

95
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,300
it will confirm the navigation.

96
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,570
If we pass false to next,

97
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,340
this will cancel the navigation

98
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,463
and the user will stay on the page.

99
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,500
So let me show this to you.

100
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,090
If we saved it and I reload users,

101
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,740
by default changes are not saved,

102
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,200
this is false by default.

103
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Hence, if I don't click save changes and I go to teams,

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,390
I'm now prompt that wherever I really wanna go,

105
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,840
and prompt was the wrong function here

106
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,453
I want to use,

107
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,120
confirm, sorry.

108
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,880
So let's use the confirm function and repeat this.

109
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,410
I am on users, I reload,

110
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,500
changes are not saved and I wanna go to teams.

111
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,420
And now I get this prompt, if I'm sure,

112
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,500
and if I click cancel, I stay on users.

113
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,990
The same if I accidentally click the back button,

114
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,810
I stay here.

115
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,250
If I of course, click okay,

116
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,883
the navigation is confirmed and I am allowed to leave,

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
but at least I get those warning,

118
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,090
and if I accidentally clicked the back button

119
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,600
or anything like that,

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,440
I don't throw away all my unsaved changes,

121
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,963
and that can dramatically enhance the user experience.

122
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,220
Of course, if I click save changes,

123
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,500
I can go without getting the warning,

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,430
because then changes saved is true.

125
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,570
And that is why "the before route leave guard,"

126
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,680
can be very useful for enhancing the user experience

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,710
you provide to your users by making sure,

128
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,263
that they don't accidentally lose their input.

129
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,420
Well, and these are the different navigation guards.

130
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,610
They run at different points of time

131
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,380
and in different places of your code,

132
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,880
you can use the place that best fits your requirements,

133
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,590
if you wanna run a guard for every navigation

134
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,950
or just for certain routes for example,

135
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,500
and with those guards,

136
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,130
you can actually provide quite nice user experiences.

137
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,590
Now as I mentioned before,

138
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,120
we'll see those guards in action

139
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,600
soon in the course project we're building,

140
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,220
and then this might make even more sense,

141
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,520
but hopefully by now,

142
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,800
you already understand why we might wanna use them,

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,543
and more importantly how they work.
