1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,456
Now in this demo app,

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:05,980
we've been working on thus far,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,697
we actually have one problem.

4
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:10,300
"Teams" works, "Users" works,

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,080
and we can view our team's members.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,330
But in reality most users would probably reach this page

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,490
by just entering your domain.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,440
And if you do that, you don't have an error,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,763
but you also don't see anything on the screen.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,620
The reason for that can actually be seen in the console.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,180
The router doesn't find any matching route

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,860
for "slash nothing."

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,530
So, for just our domain "slash nothing."

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,430
And that's not a technical error

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,070
but it might not be what you intended.

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,760
You definitely might wanna handle this

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,190
and display something on the screen.

18
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,030
Now, it of course depends on the kind of app you're building

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,540
and which routes you wanna have.

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,870
Maybe you'll have some component which you wanna show here.

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,530
Maybe you simply want to show the team's list

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,110
if the user enters "slash nothing."

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,300
But here I want to have "slash teams" in the URL

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,920
when team's lists are shown.

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,700
Simply to kind of have an expressive URL

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,220
which is all the describing the type

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,153
of content we're seeing on the page.

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,010
Of course I still wanna add a new route here,

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,510
as a first route.

30
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,370
Which is "path slash nothing."

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,810
Which should be responsible

32
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,763
for loading team's list as well.

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,623
Now as I've just said, we can offload team's list here.

34
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,710
Save this, and now see our teams

35
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,500
when we visit "slash nothing."

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,290
And everything will work

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,610
but I always wanna have "slash teams" in the URL

38
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,600
and not just "slash nothing" for loading the team's lists.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,920
So therefore, actually what I wanna do here,

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,723
is I don't wanna load the team's list component.

41
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,030
Instead I wanna redirect to this route.

42
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,010
And that's possible with the router.

43
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,190
In the route conflict, you have another option

44
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,850
which you can set on a route.

45
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,860
And that's the redirect property.

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,263
And you can set this to a path you wanna redirect to.

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,940
So that if "slash nothing" is entered,

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,823
we redirect to teams.

49
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,440
And of course you can redirect to any path you want.

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,020
And if I save this

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,330
and I now enter my domain "slash nothing,"

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,700
if I had enter, you see it changes to "slash teams"

53
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,163
and we redirect it to this page by the view router.

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,890
So that's a pretty nice feature.

55
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,150
Being able to redirect.

56
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,650
It is something which you might need a lot

57
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,283
in your applications.

58
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,530
There also is kind of an alternative to redirect.

59
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,923
You could also set the alias option.

60
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,930
Well, you would actually not set it here,

61
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,860
instead you would remove this route

62
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,810
and go to the route you wanna load

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,680
when this route is loaded.

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,440
And then add alias to that.

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,510
So, in this case the "slash teams" route.

66
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,070
And here you then add your alias path,

67
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,540
which leads to the same component.

68
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,860
So, here "slash nothing" would be an alias

69
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,800
for "slash teams."

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
If you do that and you enter "slash nothing,"

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,970
we still load the "team members" component.

72
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,020
So, it's a bit like defining "slash nothing"

73
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,620
with component team's list,

74
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,940
as we did it a couple of minutes ago.

75
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,533
With alias you can write this on a shorter forum.

76
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,850
But of course, the downside, which I don't wanna have here

77
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,720
in this use case, is that the URL doesn't change.

78
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,810
And that's the difference to a redirect.

79
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,720
With a redirect the URL is changed.

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,470
You are really redirected to a different path.

81
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,140
With an alias, the URL does not change.

82
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,100
You just load the same component as on a different route.

83
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,210
And it depends on your requirements and your application,

84
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,150
which behavior you want.

85
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,290
I don't want an alias here.

86
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,370
Instead I want to redirect as I did it before.

87
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,600
I want to redirect with "slash teams,"

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,060
save everything and therefore make sure

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,567
that when I enter nothing, I end up on "slash teams."

90
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:20,160
Another thing which we're not handling in this demo here,

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,210
is the use case that the user enters any route

92
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,570
which is not supported.

93
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,910
So, here "slash something."

94
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,090
if I enter this again, we see nothing.

95
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,400
Because we have no route defined for that.

96
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,120
Now of course we can't define routes for all possible values

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,430
that could be entered here.

98
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,283
There is an infinite amount of paths the user could enter.

99
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,850
That's why you can define "catch all" routes.

100
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,360
So here I'll add a new route at the end,

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,860
because it should have the lowest priority

102
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,920
and only kick in if no other route handles this.

103
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,290
But here the path should be slash and then something

104
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,550
which tells the router

105
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,053
that anything should match this route.

106
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,370
And for that you add a dynamic segment,

107
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,990
then any name of your choice for example "not found"

108
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,870
or "catch all," whatever you want.

109
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,820
I'll go with "not found."

110
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,717
And then brackets, and in the brackets "dot star."

111
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,190
This certainly looks strange but in the end this means,

112
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,300
it's a dynamic segment.

113
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,370
And this here is actually a regular expression.

114
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,860
This text is supported by the view router.

115
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,990
And it simply means any character combination

116
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,450
which is being used as a value here,

117
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,500
should in the handle lead to this route being loaded.

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,660
That's why this needs to come last.

119
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,810
Otherwise it would also overwrite the other routes

120
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,860
which you wanna have.

121
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,130
But if none of these routes is handling the entry path,

122
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,210
this route should kick in.

123
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,200
And here you can define which component should be loaded

124
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,280
in this case.

125
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,020
Or if you wanna redirect.

126
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,230
For example, we could redirect to "slash teams"

127
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,980
for any invalid value that's being entered.

128
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,423
So, if I saved this and I enter something,

129
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm redirected to "slash teams."

130
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,350
Alternatively you create a "not found" component.

131
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,540
Let's say, here in the Nav folder.

132
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,493
With a simple template where I say, "Page not found.

133
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:34,973
"Maybe view our" and then a router link,

134
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,890
"teams" and then close the "h2" tag

135
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,080
and then here point at "slash teams."

136
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,330
That could be our "not found" page.

137
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,550
And now we could load this component,

138
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,520
which just as a template because it doesn't need more,

139
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,880
you could add styling but I wanna keep it simple.

140
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,470
And we could load this component now

141
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,557
by importing it here into our main JSK file,

142
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:05,557
"not found from components, nav, not found, dot vue."

143
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,090
And point at that component here on this "not found" route.

144
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,673
Like this.

145
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,680
If you do this and save everything,

146
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,690
if I enter some unsupported path here,

147
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,630
we see our "not found" page,

148
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,910
where we can go back to "teams."

149
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,800
so, that is how you can handle any

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,700
invalid input the user might provide.

151
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,980
It should come last

152
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,640
so that it doesn't overwrite your other routes

153
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,490
but then it's really useful.

154
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,750
And together with the redirect feature,

155
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,630
this allows you to have full control

156
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,730
over where the user of your website is going

157
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,743
under which circumstances.
