1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,010
So can we use provide inject also for custom events?

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,050
The answer is yes,

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,800
but by implementing that a bit differently.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,850
We don't have a similar mechanism for events,

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,630
But we can think about this event thing differently.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,720
Ultimately, when a custom event is emitted,

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,630
we at some point connect a method

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,030
here in App dot Vue in this case, which should be triggered

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,173
upon this event.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,640
Well, of course, we could also pass such a method

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,480
with props down to the component where it should be called.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,430
So we could remove this SelectTopic custom event here

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,490
on knowledge base in App dot view.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,860
And we could then go to Knowledge-Base

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,290
and therefore remove it here as well

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,793
and removed is emits option and the same in knowledgeGrid.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,117
Remove this listener here on the KnowledgeElement

18
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:06,653
and remove this emits option.

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,200
And in knowledgeElement where we emit this

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,040
also not emitted here, but instead do something else.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,850
Instead here, we could expect to get the function

22
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,430
that should be called when the button is pressed as props,

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,400
or in this case, as an injected value.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,120
So we can add inject here, and then simply expect

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,177
any key of our choice any name we pick, for example,

26
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,177
SelectTopic,

27
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,250
but this name is up to you,

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,423
and then bind this here to the click.

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,580
So I expect that select topic,

30
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,300
the value which I get injected here is a function

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,133
in the end.

32
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:54,810
A function, which is then executed when this click occurs.

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,282
So I point at a function here

34
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,450
and I want to get this function as a value

35
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,863
for this Provide inject mechanism.

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,950
Now injecting it is not enough, we also need to provide it.

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,539
So we can go to App dot view.

38
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,280
And there we now need to provide that.

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,430
Now we got function that should be used

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,170
for activating a topic.

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,290
And that is our ActivateTopic method here.

42
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,730
So we can provide this SelectTopic key,

43
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,720
because that's the key I'm listening to

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,100
in KnowledgeElement. That's the key I'm injecting there,

45
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,120
so it's the key I want to provide

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,580
and the value for that is this activateTopic.

47
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,620
So I'm pointing at this method. I'm not executing it here.

48
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,270
I'm just pointing at it to let you know,

49
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,862
hey, that method here, ActivateTopic, that is the method

50
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:52,200
and therefore the function you should provide

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,823
as a value for SelectTopic.

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,730
And then when SelectTopic is injected

53
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,720
here in KnowledgeElement,

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,963
We can execute it in this component.

55
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,330
Now keep in mind that activatesTopic wants to know

56
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,860
which ID we selected. So therefore, in KnowledgeElement

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,080
where I'm pointing at selectTopic

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,350
as a to be executed function when this is clicked.

59
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,487
I should make sure that this ID,

60
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:24,710
which we're getting as a prop conveniently, is provided.

61
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,070
So I'm now calling it myself telling view

62
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,420
that this is how the function should be called eventually,

63
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,460
and that this ID should be provided to the function we get

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,660
on this selectTopic key.

65
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,580
And if we now save that and reload, this is our application,

66
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,600
and we can still pick and select the different topics.

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,530
So now this works without passing props,

68
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,790
through multiple components and without emitting

69
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,670
our custom event through multiple components.

70
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,763
It's simply a different approach.
