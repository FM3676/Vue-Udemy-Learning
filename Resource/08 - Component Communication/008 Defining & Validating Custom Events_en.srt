1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,680
So as you can clearly tell

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,200
custom events are important,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,850
an important feature for a component communication.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,070
Now, just as with props,

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,530
you can define them.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,960
You can let Vue know

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
about the events your component will emit.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,690
For props, this is actually required.

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,410
For events, it's recommended.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,690
Now I'll just close this here to gain some space.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,370
The props are still there,

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,659
I'm just collapsing this so that it takes up less space.

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,840
And I'll add a new property

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,190
to the FriendContact configuration object.

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,403
And that's the emit property.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,500
Now emits, so to say,

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,300
is the counterpart to props.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,700
In props you will define

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,890
which props this component receives.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,890
In emits, you will define which custom events

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,550
your component will eventually at some point emit.

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,620
And you're doing this to document your component,

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,290
to make it obvious to other developers,

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,050
how your component works,

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,610
and to which events they can listen.

26
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,010
This is simply useful.

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,080
It makes it easier to understand your component.

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,500
Because otherwise I have to look through all your code

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,720
to see that there is some code

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,370
where you emit toggle-favorite.

31
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,200
With emits, you would simply add

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,033
toggle

33
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,050
favorite here as a string to this disarray,

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,400
and that would make it clear that

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,530
there definitely is some code in your component,

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,303
which leads to an event with that identifier to be emitted.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,200
And you can also take emits to the next level.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,350
This is the basic form of using it,

39
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,000
and it already helps with understanding your component.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,610
But just as with props,

41
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,590
you can also specify an object instead,

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,190
and then add your admitted events

43
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,120
as keys here

44
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,750
like this,

45
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,610
and then provide a more detailed configuration.

46
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,370
The configuration you should then add is a function,

47
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,200
a function that receives the data,

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,810
which you eventually will emit as parameters.

49
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,050
So in this case,

50
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,270
we will eventually emit an ID.

51
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,260
So here we would add

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,170
ID as a parameter,

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,900
and I'm doing that to make it obvious that "toggle-favorite"

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,570
is an event that should be handled by a function

55
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,283
that expects an ID.

56
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,393
Because I will emit an ID here.

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,960
You can then also add validation here

58
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,870
to make sure that when the event is emitted,

59
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,670
this data, which should be part of the event

60
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,690
is not forgotten.

61
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,230
We can check if ID exists,

62
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,930
if this is true

63
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,590
and return true, if that's the case

64
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,610
and else return false,

65
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,007
and maybe also issue a warning in the console that

66
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,930
ID is missing,

67
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,940
to help developers that are emitting this event,

68
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,293
catch this error.

69
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,000
And now, for example,

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,460
if I remove this second argument here,

71
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,930
and I saved that

72
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,870
and I click "toggle-favorite",

73
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,640
I get an error here.

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
But before that error,

75
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,660
I actually also get a warning

76
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,460
invalid event arguments,

77
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,880
event validation failed for event "toggle-favorite",

78
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,430
ID is missing.

79
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,800
So this is something which you don't have to add,

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,240
but which can make your life as a developer easier,

81
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,420
especially again if you're working in a team.

82
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,320
Now let's bring this ID back

83
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,350
and I will not add this detailed of a validation

84
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,270
to the custom events throughout the course.

85
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,670
But since it is the complete guide,

86
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,700
I of course want to show this to you

87
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,303
so that you know this feature.

88
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,810
Nonetheless, I will revert to this here,

89
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,200
and go back to this simpler definition,

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,730
which is the approach I will use throughout the course

91
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,430
simply to make it obvious

92
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,393
which custom events this component will eventually emit.
