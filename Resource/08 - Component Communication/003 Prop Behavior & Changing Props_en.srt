1
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:04,450
Now as I emphasized in the last lecture,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,560
props are super important.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,670
We use them for something which is also called

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,290
parent child communication.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,770
So the parent component or app in this case,

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,110
our main app, communicates

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,280
to its child HTML element

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,750
to its child component.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,233
In this case to the friend contact component.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,670
The friend contact component, is a child of this app

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,023
because we use it in the template of the app.

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,380
On the other hand, for friend contact,

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,270
the app would be the parent,

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,010
because well, friend contact

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,380
gets used in the template of app.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,680
So these are just terms you can keep in mind,

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,780
parent and child.

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,130
And we use props to communicate

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,500
from the parent to the child.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,910
So to pass data from the parent to the child component

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,823
from app to friend contact, in our case.

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,670
Now here's one important thing you have to know about props

23
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,660
and which you should keep in mind.

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,340
Props typically should not be mutated.

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,130
And what do I mean by that?

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,740
Let's add a new prop.

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,461
Let's say here in App.vue,

28
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:14,010
we have is favorite prop,

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,030
which we passed to friend contact.

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,850
And the value I pass here,

31
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,070
is one for a true or a zero for false.

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,028
So here I pass isFavorite.

33
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:27,373
And here let's say I set this to zero.

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,120
Now that's a new prop, which we do for should add

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,113
here in friend contact isFavorite written like this.

36
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,800
Now we've got, this isFavorite prop.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,960
Now let's say we wanna use that to output

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,163
some extra information after the name.

39
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,820
Here with interpolation,

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,450
I'm checking if isFavorite is equal to one

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,800
and if that's the case,

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,650
I'll put some extra text here,

43
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,480
otherwise I won't.

44
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,970
And the extra text is a pair of parentheses where I say

45
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,803
Favorite.

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,010
If I now save that and reload,

47
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,620
you see Favorite after Manuel Lawrence,

48
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,280
because that is where I added isFavorite.

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,750
And after Julie Jones, we don't see that because there,

50
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,260
I set isFavorite to zero.

51
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,270
Now, why am I doing that?

52
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,450
Well, let's also see we have another button here,

53
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,223
which allows us to change the favorite status.

54
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,010
I'll say Toggle Favorite on the button.

55
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,460
And I'll add a new method.

56
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,320
toggleFavorite could be the name

57
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,660
to which I wanna point here

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,620
with the click listener on that button.

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,910
And now we add this method here

60
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,043
in the methods, toggleFavorite.

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
And in here, I'll check if this isFavorite is equal to one.

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,620
So if we were a favorite,

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,897
in which case I'll set it to zero

64
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:03,723
and otherwise, if isFavorite was zero I'll set it to one.

65
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,790
we could do it as to change the favorite status

66
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,290
with help of the button.

67
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,773
If we saved it, we get an error here.

68
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,900
The error is unexpected mutation of isFavorite prop.

69
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,250
As I mentioned, that's not something you should do.

70
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,340
Now, why should you not do that?

71
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,370
Because Vue uses a concept which is called

72
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,910
unidirectional data flow.

73
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,930
Now that's again a fancy term,

74
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,900
but it means one simple thing.

75
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,770
Data passed from app to friend contact

76
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,170
should only be changed in app, not in friend contact.

77
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,210
We just pass data down to friend contact.

78
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,700
And once the data is passed down,

79
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,110
friend contact cannot change the data we manage an app view,

80
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,220
at least not by simply changing the received data.

81
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,820
So if we change data inside of friend contact like here,

82
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,100
when I tried to change isFavorite,

83
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,360
this is not allowed by Vue,

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,410
because we violate this pattern

85
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,913
of having a unidirectional data flow.

86
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,950
Now, if we want to change this,

87
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,660
there are two ways of doing that.

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,230
The first way of doing it, is that we let the parent know

89
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,360
that we'd like to change this.

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,250
Then the parent can go ahead and change the data in itself

91
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,970
and pass the updated data back to friend contact.

92
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,630
That's a pattern we'll explore later.

93
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,860
It's an important pattern

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,090
and will therefore have a detailed look at it soon.

95
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,850
The other approach is that we simply take the received data

96
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,240
as the initial data, inside of friend contact,

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,520
and then we changed that data instead of friend contact,

98
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,410
but we are aware of the fact that we only change it there

99
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,200
and that this won't affect the data in App.vue.

100
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,500
To implement this pattern,

101
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,850
all we need to do is we need to add a new data property

102
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,063
in our component,

103
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,900
for example, friendisFavorite.

104
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,120
So using a different name than I used here

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,410
and now we'll set this equal to this isFavorite.

106
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,453
So set it equal to the received prop value.

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,730
Then we use the received prop value just as an initial value

108
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,560
for friendisFavorite.

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,044
And now friend is Favorite can be used here,

110
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:27,770
friendisFavorite,

111
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,873
in the template,

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,050
but also in the rest of the code.

113
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,050
And if we now change that friendisFavorite property,

114
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,200
that will be okay,

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,220
because that's now our regular data property,

116
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,080
where the prop we received

117
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,090
is just used to set an initial value.

118
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,743
So now that works and I can toggle this favorite status.

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm emphasizing this and talking about this

120
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,820
because this unidirectional data flow

121
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,710
is an important concept.

122
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,060
Now of course you will have scenarios

123
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
where you want to be able

124
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,170
to change the original data

125
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,060
you got from the App.vue file.

126
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,950
So where just using it as initial data

127
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,250
and then changing it internally is not enough.

128
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,820
Therefore, we'll also very soon

129
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,090
have a look at how you can implement that,

130
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,570
for the moment be aware that you should not mutate props,

131
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,910
but if you need to do it,

132
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,830
you can just take a prop as an initial value

133
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,163
and then change the component exclusive property and stat.
