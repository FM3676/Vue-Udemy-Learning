1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,660
So we learned about provide inject

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,550
in the last lectures.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,010
And it is a very powerful tool built into vue.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,670
It's very useful for letting components communicate.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,485
It's important for you to keep in mind

6
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,140
that you can only communicate

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,630
between parent and child components

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,800
or child components of other child components

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,690
so that you can't use it to communicate

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,910
between neighbors or anything like that,

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,763
as I explained and showed over the last lectures.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,970
But here's also one other important thing,

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,970
you should not always use provide inject

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,600
to replace props and custom events.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,750
Indeed props and custom events

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,530
should be your default communication mechanism.

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,080
You might consider using provide inject though,

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,190
if you find yourself having some pass through components,

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,540
as we had it here.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,910
Knowledge base was just a component passing through props

21
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,630
and passing through the immediate event.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,520
In such cases using provide inject

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,410
can save you some unnecessary code

24
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,020
and can make your code base a bit leaner.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,370
You could also argue that it makes a code

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,460
a bit harder to understand though,

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,330
because if I look at this code,

28
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,660
I see that I got two provided values here in App.vue

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,940
but then I have to dig into all the components

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,370
to understand where those values are being used.

31
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,000
This is absolutely doable in this app,

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,060
since it's not a complex app,

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,360
but it is something that can be cumbersome in bigger apps.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,630
So use it wisely.

35
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,970
And if you have a lot of pass through components,

36
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,270
definitely use it.

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,770
If you have just one pass through component,

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,440
you might still be fine with using props and custom events,

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,080
even though you have some redundant code though.

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
But that is up to you

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,930
and ultimately comes down to your personal preferences.

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,140
With provide inject and props and custom events,

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,780
you got all the core tools though,

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,740
which you need to let components communicate

45
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,603
with each other.
