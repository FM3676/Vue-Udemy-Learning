1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,250
In this module here,

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,412
we're going to pick up on this component concept

3
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:10,160
and we're going to take it to the next level.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,160
You will learn how to build really reusable components

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,180
and how to communicate between components.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,860
This will be super-important

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,372
because only with the knowledge you gain in this module,

8
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:26,020
only with that, you'll be able to build

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,020
a rich user interfaces in Vue applications with components,

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,400
and you will see why components are such a powerful thing,

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,410
such a powerful concept,

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,560
and why modern Vue applications in the end

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,940
are all about components.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,175
Now for that, we'll get there step-by-step.

15
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:50,380
We'll start building a user interface with components

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,080
to get an understanding for how we combine

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,670
these different building blocks.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,040
And we'll then also explore how those components

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,460
can communicate with each other,

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,860
which basically means

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,480
how you can pass data between components.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,980
Because as you'll see,

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,280
and as you actually already saw a bit

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,040
in the component introduction module,

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,130
passing data to components, and between components

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,000
will be an important concept.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,530
Now, last but not least,

28
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,070
you will also see that there are different ways

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,970
of communication and you will learn which approaches exist

30
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,410
and when you use which approach.

31
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,240
So therefore, let's not waste any time.

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,460
And let's get started with working with components

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,853
and with letting them talk to each other.
