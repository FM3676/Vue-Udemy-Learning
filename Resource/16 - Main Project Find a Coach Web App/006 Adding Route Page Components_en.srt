1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,430
So let's work on the pages.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,910
Here in the source folder,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,960
I'll add a new pages folder,

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,440
which will hold the components

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,170
that are loaded as pages through routing.

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,740
It's not a must-do to use a pages folder for that

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,180
but I like to set those components apart

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,440
from the other components,

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,400
which are not loaded as pages.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
That's just personal preference though.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,540
And in there, I'll actually add two subfolders.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,900
A coaches subfolder and a requests subfolder

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,340
because these are the two main features we have in this app

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,393
and will have different pages for these different features.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,690
And in the pages folder itself,

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,040
I'll also add a file, the NotFound.vue component,

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,490
which will be our Not Found page.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,980
In the coaches subfolder,

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,450
we can then add all the coach pages

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,106
and that would be the page for all the coaches

21
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:58,320
for a specific coach

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,600
and for registering as a coach.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,160
And for requests,

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,820
the pages will be the contact page here

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,970
and the open requests page.

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,190
So let's start with the coaches pages.

27
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,190
Here, I wanna have a CoachesList.vue component.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,200
CoachDetail.vue component.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
And a CoachRegistration.vue component.

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,750
In requests, that would be ContactCoach.vue

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,120
and RequestsReceieved.vue.

32
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,810
Now, obviously, how you name these files,

33
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,500
how you name these components is 100% up to you.

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,070
You don't have to use the same naming I do here,

35
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,950
it's just my personal preference.

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,593
Not something you have to use.

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,949
Now, all these components are created.

38
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:53,620
Obviously though, they're all empty.

39
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,520
Nonetheless, we can wire them up to the router file already

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,450
and then fill them with live step by step.

41
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,210
So for that here in router.js,

42
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,970
I'm going to import all those page components,

43
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,200
like the CoachDetail component

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,200
from ./pages/coaches/CoachDetail.vue

45
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,130
and well, all the other files as well.

46
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,130
CoachesList from pages/coaches/CoachesList.vue.

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,370
And CoachRegistration

48
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:30,507
from the pages/coaches/CoachRegistration.vue file.

49
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,090
Import ContactCoach from pages/coaches,

50
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,267
not coaches, sorry, requests/ContactCoach.vue.

51
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,507
And import RequestsReceived

52
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:55,003
from ./pages/requests/RequestsReceived.vue.

53
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,900
And last but not least, import NotFound

54
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,883
from pages/NotFound.vue.

55
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,750
Okay, these are all the components.

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,790
So now we can wire them up to the routes.

57
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,530
For the /coaches route,

58
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,840
we wanna load the CoachesList component.

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,850
For coaches/:id, that would be the CoachDetail component.

60
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,540
For contacting a coach,

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,233
that would be the ContactCoach component.

62
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,930
For registering, that would be

63
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,014
the CoachRegistration component.

64
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:30,590
For requests, so for the requests we received,

65
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,960
that would be the RequestsReceived component.

66
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,230
And here it's the NotFound component.

67
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,180
So now with that, we registered all components.

68
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,170
Now we can fill them with life.

69
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,674
Before we do that though,

70
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:44,350
we need one other important component.

71
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,960
The app component, the main component

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,793
that holds all the other components in the end.

73
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,850
So therefore, next to main.js,

74
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,900
I'll add a App.vue file

75
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,220
and this will be, of course, the main entry point

76
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,490
of our application so to say.

77
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,650
Here, I wanna render my router-view.

78
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,590
So in the template here,

79
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,850
I want to output router-view

80
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,900
so that we tell the view router

81
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,870
where to render these different components we registered

82
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,870
and it's the App file I wanna import here in main.js.

83
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,000
So import App from App.vue

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,880
to load the App here as our main App.

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
In addition, we of course, also need

86
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,680
to make this app aware of the router,

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,650
so besides importing App.vue here,

88
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,650
I'll also import router from ./router.js

89
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,740
and store the App here

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,360
in a constant

91
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,030
and on that app, we can then use router

92
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,540
so that we really use the router in this app.

93
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,570
And now we're done with the routing

94
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,423
and we're all set to continue.

95
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,740
So with all that out of the way,

96
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,804
now it's time to fill it all with life.

97
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:59,600
And it's totally up to you

98
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,085
what filling this with life means.

99
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,430
We'll definitely need a couple of different things here

100
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,540
but in the end,

101
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,320
I would say that when we visit just our domain,

102
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,340
we redirect to /coaches,

103
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,360
so that is probably the first page we're going to see

104
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,570
if we use this page, this application in a normal way.

105
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,890
So maybe we should start with CoachesList,

106
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,633
at least with a very basic first version of it.
