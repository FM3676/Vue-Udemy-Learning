1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,030
Now with all the course modules

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,670
you completed up to this point, you learned a lot about Vue.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,120
And of course, you already practiced a lot with Vue too.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,110
We already had a couple of projects,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,110
and we had tons of demos, assignments and challenges.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,860
Now however, it's time for our main course project,

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,083
the Coach Finder application.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,083
Now, here is the web app we are going to build

9
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,180
throughout this module.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,170
It's an application where we got a bunch of coaches here,

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,780
we can filter those coaches, to for example

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,720
find a coach that is able to teach us backend development,

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,010
we can then contact this coach,

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,610
leave our email address, and share a message.

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,880
Now this message has been sent to the coach

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,490
and under requests, we can view all the incoming requests,

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,730
all the incoming messages.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,450
We can then use the email address to reply back.

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,340
Now this application,

20
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,180
has basically all we learned throughout this course.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,390
It uses routing and animations as you can tell.

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,800
It also uses Vuex to manage data

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,720
and it uses a bunch of components as you can see here.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,360
It uses all kinds of ways of communicating

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,450
between components, Vuex and props and route parameters,

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,770
and you will see how all these things work together

27
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,010
step by step and in great detail.

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,990
This is a big Vue application,

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,630
which we are going to build together from the ground up

30
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,100
where all the things we learned will come together.

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,860
Routing, Vuex, Components, HTTP, everything.

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,590
It'll all be in that project and therefore

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,950
with this project you will get a complete demo

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,610
and a lot of practice

35
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,940
when it comes to building an entire app from the ground up.

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,660
You can definitely also take this as a challenge

37
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,830
and try this on your own first,

38
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,540
but we will build this app from the ground up,

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,449
including the planning phase together

40
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,683
step by step throughout this module.

41
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,530
We'll add routing and Vuex and a lot of other features

42
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,340
and with this module,

43
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,140
you will not just get another app and more practice,

44
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,770
but you will also see a lot of common conventions

45
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,450
and practices and you will learn how to solve problems.

46
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,393
So with that, let's dive right in.
