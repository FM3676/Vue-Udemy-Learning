1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,410
So now that we've got a plan

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,560
it's of course time to implement it

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,230
and to write the code we need.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,497
And here I would like to get started by setting up

5
00:00:10,497 --> 00:00:14,400
the routes sent to pages we need for this application.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,880
I then wanna continue building all the core components

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,240
we need for now and then I wanna slowly step by step,

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,180
add in the data and to functionality we need.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,720
So therefore, first of all,

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,230
I'll install two extra packages in a new project,

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,410
which you again, by the way, find attached,

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,600
you find this basic project set up,

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,210
which has just Vue and nothing else attached

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,370
to this lecture

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,220
but in this project set up all now npm install

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,870
with dash dash save,

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,170
I'll npm install, view dash router,

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,240
and view X, these two packages,

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,313
because we're going to use both through out this module.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,630
Notice we'll download and install these two packages

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,790
into this project and once this is done,

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,720
we can use both

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,660
but as I said, I'll start with routing.

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,500
Now for this here, next to main js,

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,483
I'll add a router js file because I wanna store

26
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:14,110
all my routes and my routing logic in there

27
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,180
to keep main JS lean,

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,030
and therefore, as so often, or first of all,

29
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,460
import create a router from Vue-router here

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,200
in the router js file,

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,110
and then create a router by calling createRouter.

32
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,480
And then we will export this router

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,790
so that we can use it in our files,

34
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,060
namely in the main js file as well.

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,350
Now you'll learn how to configure the router,

36
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,100
you simply pass an object to create router

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,250
and here we then add our routes.

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,960
Now you might remember that besides the routes,

39
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,930
we also need to set his history property here

40
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,330
and there we import another function from view router

41
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,220
and that's to create web history function

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,050
and we call this function here

43
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,630
and the value provided by calling that function is then set

44
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,083
as a value for this history property here.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,410
With that, we can add our routes array here

46
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,840
for the routes property

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,720
and in their setup all the routes we want.

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,820
And here we made a plan, right?

49
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,050
We thought about a couple of routes

50
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,470
which we will need.

51
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,600
So I'm going to add those routes here.

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,340
And this was a slash coaches route

53
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,740
which should load our coaches component later.

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,340
We don't have that component yet

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,610
so for the moment I'll set this to null,

56
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,123
but later we will point at the coach has component here,

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,160
besides that we also want that coaches slash ID route

58
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,770
where the dynamic coach ID part of the path,

59
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,363
and then we load the details page for different coaches.

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,853
So that was another route we wanted here.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We also wanted another path here to register as a coach.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,893
So to sign up as a coach,

63
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,710
that is something we'll need.

64
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,870
And we'll need a route where we can also contact a coach.

65
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,270
And now that could be slash contact.

66
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,370
But, I would say actually,

67
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,450
we want to contact a specific coach identified by ID.

68
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,850
So maybe that's something

69
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,200
where we can use a nested route even

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,040
so we could add children here to coaches slash ID

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,340
and in there register a nested route

72
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,580
where we have contact after a coaches slash ID

73
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,730
so that would be loaded with slash coaches

74
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,260
then some coach ID slash contact.

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,820
That's how this route and this component

76
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,070
should be loaded later

77
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,370
so that we reached a contact page

78
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,783
with a form for a very specific coach.

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,940
So therefore we won't have contact down there,

80
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,950
but we will definitely need a requests route here

81
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,380
where we can view all the requests we might've received

82
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,090
so all the messages sent through that contact form.

83
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,920
And that's almost it there's just one more route

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,160
which I'll add here and that is a catch all route

85
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,200
and not found route for when the user adds

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,530
or enters something invalid as a path,

87
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,720
then I wanna show a not found page.

88
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,530
And you might remember from the routing section

89
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,720
how that worked.

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,930
You need a dynamic segment here in the end

91
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,870
with any text of your choice,

92
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,260
but then important this bracket syntax at the end,

93
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,590
where you in the end have a regular expression

94
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,850
just saying that no matter what was entered here,

95
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,103
you wanna handle it with this route.

96
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,840
And actually now that I think about it

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,930
there's one more route which we'll need

98
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,670
since we have no slash route here,

99
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,620
we just have slash coaches slash register

100
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,820
we're not doing anything

101
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,540
if the user reaches just slash nothing,

102
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,070
which will be the case though,

103
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,150
if just our domain is entered and therefore

104
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,200
if just our domain slash nothing is entered

105
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,823
I want to redirect to slash coaches here.

106
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,490
So that's the route set up

107
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,770
I wanna work with for this module for this project,

108
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,613
now we need to build those pages, those components

109
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:27,100
that should be loaded for the different routes.

110
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,480
Now, as for everything else in this module,

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,610
definitely also try such things on your own,

112
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,480
maybe don't continue with the next video right away

113
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,560
instead try building these page components

114
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,060
for these different pages and wire them up to the routes.

115
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,470
You can try building the entire project

116
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,010
as a challenge as well, it's up to you,

117
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,670
how much you wanna progress together with me,

118
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,660
and how much you wanna try on your own.

119
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,310
Starting in the next lecture,

120
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,763
I will add those page components though.
