1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,420
So CoachesList.vue it is

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,880
that's the first page I wanna start with.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,880
And this will become a quite complex page in the end

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,870
because you might remember that on there

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,270
I don't just wanted to output a list of coaches,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,590
I also wanted to add some filtering logic so that

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,120
we can filter the list of coaches which is displayed.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,630
And outputting a list of coaches also means that we need

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,890
coaches to begin with

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,653
and at the moment we're not managing any data at all.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,090
But we can get started with the base template at least.

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,040
And here to get started with this base template,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,530
I of course add a template here to CoachesList.vue,

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,263
but now in there, what do we need?

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,820
We will have a section or a div, whatever you want,

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,680
where we later we'll have to filter.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,563
And below that we'll have another part of this page,

18
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:58,930
another section, another div,

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,310
where we will have our list of coaches.

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,180
These will be the two main areas.

21
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,180
Now I will create two separate sub components for that

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,743
so that our coaches list components stays relatively lean.

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,260
But at least we now got a basic template, a dummy template,

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,820
which should allow us to see something on the screen

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,970
when this page is visited.

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,670
So if you run our development server with npm run serve,

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,980
let's see if we can at least see this on the screen

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,373
when we visit our application.

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,120
And indeed, if I load this page, I'm redirected to /coaches

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,230
and I see filter and list of coaches.

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,400
Now the styling obviously is off,

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,070
I mean the entire content is missing

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,210
but I can already tell that this is also

34
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,780
not the font I wanna use.

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,060
So I wanna set up some global styling,

36
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,760
some base styling in App vue,

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,530
which will apply to the entire app.

38
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,780
And this is therefore not scoped styling but just a style

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,340
so that it is applied globally.

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,920
And I prepared to the styling for you

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,009
because I don't wanna write the styles together with you

42
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,070
as this is not a CSS course

43
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,760
and I know from other courses

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,970
that it's boring to some people if you write too much CSS

45
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,830
hence I'll provide all the CSS code for you.

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,450
Of course, you can also tweak it to your own needs.

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,030
You can adjust it to look the way you want it to look,

48
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,610
whatever you want.

49
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,320
So attached, you find this app CSS file

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,330
and in there you find the styles which you should copy

51
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,980
into these style text of your App vue file.

52
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,560
An import to Google fonts, where I load a font

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,380
and then well, I set up some basic stylings,

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,060
set up that base font, remove the margin on the body

55
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,140
and with this applied, we now have this font in effect.

56
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,830
So now that works, that looks well,

57
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,140
not the way I want it to look

58
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,970
but it has the space styling at least.

59
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,280
Now, how should we continue though?

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,290
I mean, this page is pretty much worthless

61
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,250
if we don't have any coaches that could be output here.

62
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,960
So therefore I see two possible routes we can take.

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,850
We can either now start adding the Vuex

64
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,070
and start adding data,

65
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,350
or we first of all finish up the entire base layout

66
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,100
and navigation, we add a header to this application

67
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,280
so that we can reach all pages

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,010
and we have some dummy code on all pages

69
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,380
and we then add to data and I'll go with that second route.

70
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,670
I'll first of all wire up the navigation and the base layout

71
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,823
before I then come back to the data.

72
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,067
So to add some basic layout and some basic navigation,

73
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,390
I will go to the source folder

74
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,448
and add a components folder next to pages.

75
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:53,448
And in there, I'll add let's say a layout folder

76
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,710
and in that layout folder, we can add TheHeader.Vue file,

77
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,300
which should hold the base header

78
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,630
with the navigation we want in this application.

79
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,630
This, TheHeader component will be used in the App vue file

80
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,253
above the router view.

81
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,519
So here we can add a script already in App vue

82
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,519
and import TheHeader from components/layoutTheHeader.Vue

83
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,020
and register this as a local component here in App vue.

84
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,520
A local component because we only use it here.

85
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,520
And then here we can render TheHeader above the router view.

86
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,690
Now here, back in TheHeader.vue,

87
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,170
the question is what do we want in here in the template?

88
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,030
Well, I want TheHeader HTML element,

89
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,350
which should hold my navigation

90
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,560
and as part of the navigation, I'll have the main title

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,560
of this page so to say, where I wanna say something like

92
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,163
Find a Coach.

93
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,210
And next to that, also an unordered list

94
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,680
where we have our different navigation items

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,690
and that of course should be a router links.

96
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,440
And actually even that text here in the h1 element

97
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,380
should be a router link because it should be clickable

98
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,223
and should always lead us back to the starting page.

99
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,050
So here I want to go to /nothing

100
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,730
which will then redirect to coaches,

101
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,540
but this will basically always go back

102
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,653
to the root entry page of this app.

103
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,360
Here, I also wanna go to /coaches let's say,

104
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,190
which of course is basically the same

105
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,150
as clicking on this title, but here I wanna say All Coaches.

106
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,820
So this will be one of the navigation items we have.

107
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,970
And the other item we'll have, we'll go to /requests

108
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,940
to show us the requests we received

109
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,100
so the messages that were sent by users to us

110
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,513
if we are registered as a coach.

111
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,520
If we are not, we won't see any requests here.

112
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,520
So this is the basic set up here for TheHeader let's say.

113
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,290
I don't need any script here at the moment

114
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,550
because there's nothing dynamic in here,

115
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,240
nothing that would need a Vue script code.

116
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,240
But of course, I want to have some styling here

117
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,453
and I want to have some scoped CSS code in here.

118
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,310
And again, you find that attached,

119
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,010
you find TheHeader CSS file attached,

120
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,500
which contains a bunch of styles I prepared for you,

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,600
which you can just copy between those style tacks

122
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,660
so that we all use the same styling.

123
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm basically just giving TheHeader

124
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,690
a certain width and a certain color

125
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,340
and then it's all just about styling the links

126
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,460
and the active links, that's important,

127
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,940
the active router link

128
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,697
by using that router link active clause,

129
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:02,740
which you learned would be applied to the link

130
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,760
that's responsible for the current page.

131
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,750
And then I also have some other styles

132
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,390
for laying things out correctly.

133
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,590
With that we got TheHeader and if we now reload,

134
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,020
this is what we should see.

135
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,070
You see All Coaches is active

136
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,530
and we could also go to Requests

137
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,140
where we don't see anything on the screen,

138
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,850
but switching to page works.

139
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,310
So that's TheHeader off this application now.

140
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,990
And with that, we made a good step forward

141
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,190
because now we've got a first basic way

142
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,860
of navigating around.

143
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,420
Now let's also work on the other pages

144
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,343
and add some meat to them.
