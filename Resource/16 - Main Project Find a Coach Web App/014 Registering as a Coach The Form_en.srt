1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,300
So for that, let's go to coach registration,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,340
and replace this dummy text with a proper template.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,910
Here, I want to have a section, let's say,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,910
where I say an h2 tag, register as a coach now,

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,270
and below that, I wanna have the entire form for signing up.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,700
Eventually, this component will grow a little bit,

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,780
later once we add HTTP requests.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,880
Therefore I will outsource this form into

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,110
a separate component right away.

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,110
Add the coachform.vue file here in components coaches,

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,393
and then we'll have the actual form in there.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,910
So here in the template,

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,810
I want to have a form element of course,

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,840
because we'll well, have a form in here.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,290
This form needs a couple of controls,

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,100
because every coach has a first and last name,

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,450
areas of expertise, a description,

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,560
and an hourly rate.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,403
We need these input fields in our form.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,810
Hence here, I'll get started by adding

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,180
a div with a class of form-control,

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,403
which is important for styling later.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,220
Where I now add a label saying first name,

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,050
and below that input field with a type of text

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,550
and let's say an ID of first name therefore this label,

26
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,530
it gets the for attribute and points

27
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,773
at this element with this ID.

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,540
Then I'm going to duplicate this

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,160
because we also of course need a last name.

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,620
So here is last name on the second input,

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,280
and then we also need an input for the description.

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,700
Duplicate it again for the description here,

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,120
pointing at description, but now here

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,630
it's not an input, but let's say a text area element.

35
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,200
So that we have a multi-line input.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,720
I'll give that an idea of description

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,803
and let's say five rows.

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,320
Then again, I'm going to copy the default input here

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,710
and set up the hourly rate input field,

40
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,720
so here the ID is rate,

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,810
and the type here can be number, or should be number

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,900
to make sure that well, we allow the user

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,403
to enter a number here in a pleasant way.

44
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,420
Now as a last step, users should be able

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,820
to choose their area of expertise.

46
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,220
Now that means that I wanna have free checkboxes

47
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,500
where users can check the expertise they have.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,820
So front and back and then career,

49
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,060
and you can select as many as you know,

50
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,610
or as many as you feel comfortable teaching others.

51
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,120
So therefore again, I'll add a div here,

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,653
with a class of form control, this doesn't change.

53
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,767
But inside of here, I now first of all want

54
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,640
to have a h3 tag where I say,

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,030
areas of expertise to let the user know

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,970
what these checkboxes will be about,

57
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,900
then I'll have more divs in there.

58
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,593
Every div then holds an input of type checkbox,

59
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,970
and this first one, will have an ideal front-end

60
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,130
and a value of front-end,

61
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,040
the value will be important later

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,826
for retrieving the checkboxes.

63
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:41,826
After the input, also a label for front-end in this case,

64
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,520
where I'll say front-end development,

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,173
letting the user know what this checkbox means.

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,270
Now we replicate this twice,

67
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,130
to also have a checkbox for back-end

68
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,130
with a value of back-end for back-end,

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,233
and here saying back-end development.

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,400
Then on the last checkbox here,

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,990
I say career, with a value of Career,

72
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,990
for a career and saying career advisory maybe.

73
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:28,190
These are the different checkboxes here,

74
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,670
now with that, below all those divs,

75
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,520
I'll add a base-button,

76
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,120
which will be the submit button in the end,

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,163
where I simply say register.

78
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,830
Now that's the basic form.

79
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,720
We'll come back to that markup later,

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
we also need to add bindings

81
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,960
and I also wanna add validation later,

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,530
but that's a start.

83
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,760
With that form created now,

84
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,520
we can add our script area here, our script block,

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
and add some data here.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,950
So here I return the data object

87
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,740
and in there, I of course want to manage a first name

88
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,860
and a last name field,

89
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,360
which we will bind with the model later,

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,340
add a description and a rate

91
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,640
which initially is null let's say,

92
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,640
areas which initially is an empty array and that is it.

93
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,350
Now we can bind these data properties

94
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,000
with two way binding.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,280
So here, on the first input with the model,

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,810
I bind this to first name,

97
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,803
which is that first name data property we just added.

98
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,260
Then here on the second input,

99
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,910
I of course, bind it to last name,

100
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,423
here on the text area that is bound to description,

101
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,810
and here the rate that is bound to rate.

102
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,090
Now here I will use the number modifier

103
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,540
to force a conversion to number,

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,780
I showed you that this should happen automatically

105
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,110
if the type is number but to be super safe,

106
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,250
I'll force it here, and whilst we're at it,

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,490
I'll actually add trim on the other V model such as,

108
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,873
so that we always trim excess whitespace,

109
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,150
and with that only the checkboxes are left,

110
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,760
Here we can also use V model

111
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,610
as you learned earlier in the course,

112
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,380
here we can bind this to areas,

113
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,660
here we bind to the same property on all checkboxes,

114
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,860
of course, because they all belong together.

115
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,290
Now with that, I'll go down to the script part again

116
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,340
and add a method, a method that should be triggered

117
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,230
when the form is submitted.

118
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,183
Hence, I'll name it, submit form.

119
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:52,680
In here, we will later validate the form,

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,180
but for the moment, I'll just create

121
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,260
a form data object

122
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,320
where I group all those values together.

123
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,390
Here, I wanna have a first key,

124
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,730
which points at this first name,

125
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,970
a last key, which points to this last name,

126
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,460
a desk key, which points at this description.

127
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,330
You could use the same names of course here,

128
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,040
but I'll go with these names

129
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,470
I will also use these names later in the course.

130
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,763
So maybe you should stick to them to follow along smoothly.

131
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,533
bind the rate to this rate, and areas to this areas.

132
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,600
For the moment, I'll just console.log,

133
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,613
my form data here to see whether that worked.

134
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,460
Now it's submit form which is bound here,

135
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,390
to the submit event on the form element

136
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,370
where I used the prevent modifier

137
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,670
to prevent the default of an automatic request being sent

138
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,170
to a server that doesn't exist

139
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,670
which I don't want here and bind this

140
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,310
to submit form like that.

141
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,520
Now we can use the coach form here in coach registration,

142
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,220
so there in the script area,

143
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,220
we import coachform from going up and going up

144
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,193
to components, coaches, coachform.vue,

145
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,423
then adding this here to the components option like that.

146
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,950
Now we can simply add the coachform

147
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,863
as a HTML element, so to say here in coach registration.

148
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,180
If we load this, we see this form.

149
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,070
Now it's of course super ugly,

150
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,360
so there are two changes I wanna make.

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,470
First of all, in coach registration in this section,

152
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,923
use the base-card to wrap the h2 tag and the form,

153
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,930
and inside of coachform, I of course prepared

154
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,510
a couple of styles which we can use.

155
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,510
Here at the bottom, we add scoped styling as always,

156
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,660
then attach to find styles

157
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,000
which you should copy in here.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,030
The coachform CSS file.

159
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,940
There are some styles which we're not even using yet,

160
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,730
like the invalid styles,

161
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,620
but we will need them later once we add form validation.

162
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,210
With that, if you save this,

163
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,610
this all looks much nicer,

164
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,030
now we got our registration form in place.

165
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,900
If I click Register,

166
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,500
I print an empty object here, and I get a warning,

167
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,710
which we can ignore here for the moment.

168
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,483
But I'm getting this object here,

169
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,320
in this object, we see of course,

170
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,420
that everything is empty

171
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,200
because we haven't entered anything.

172
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,483
So if I clear this now and do enter some values here,

173
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,160
like that, and register this.

174
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,180
Now we see our values here, in areas

175
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,050
which is wrapped by a proxy to be reactive,

176
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,800
we see front-end and career being checked,

177
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,090
we see the other data as well and therefore,

178
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,330
we are ready to pass that data on

179
