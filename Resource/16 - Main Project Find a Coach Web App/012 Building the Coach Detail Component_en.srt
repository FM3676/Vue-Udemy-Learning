1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,930
So onwards to the coach detail page,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,810
it's time to replace the dummy content we got here

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,403
with some real content.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,850
For that I'm going to get rid of all the continent here

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,020
and write this from scratch again.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,823
In this component, I want to have a section,

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,270
where I first of all, let's say using that base card,

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,140
I would put the name and the rate of the coach.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,110
So here we could have the h2 tag,

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,383
where we output the full name.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,260
And below that age h3 tag, where we output it to rate.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,260
So dollar sign then interpolate to rate

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,350
and then make it clear that it's an hourly rate

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,883
by adding /hour.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,370
The next section of data which I wanna have

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,370
on this page here is let's say the contact button.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,193
So here again using the base card,

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,367
I will add a number h2 tag actually, like this

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,070
where I wanna say interested, reach out now.

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,610
And below that render a base button, which of course

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,040
will technically be a link, so we should add the link prop

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,850
going to the contact page for this specific coach.

23
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,610
Now of course this coach will have a dynamic ID,

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,140
We can view this page for different coaches.

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,500
So I will bind to two contact link,

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,600
which is a computed property just like full name

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,620
which we will add soon.

28
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,823
And on this button, I'll just say contact.

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,510
Actually, I'll put this into a header tag here,

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,133
the h2 tag and the button.

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,700
And below that now at the router view,

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,170
where later does nested child route

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,403
to contact forum will be rendered.

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,340
And now below that section with the contact forum

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,740
at the contact button below that section.

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,370
I'll add a number of section where I use a base card

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,620
in which I want to show the badges.

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,920
So the areas of expertise using the base badge component

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,330
and below that the description for that coach.

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,050
So here a paragraph where output description.

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,860
Tt's not something we rendered before in any component

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,363
it should of course be included in the details.

43
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,010
And on the badge we use v-for to go through the area

44
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,010
in areas, bind to key to area, bind the type two area

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,440
and bind the title two area.

46
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,423
So basically as we did it before.

47
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,180
Now for the script section here,

48
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,040
of course we get props here and actually I don't get

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,450
all these values here as props,

50
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,530
but I just get an ID as a prop.

51
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,133
Now, why do I get an ID as a prop here?

52
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,860
keep in mind, how does component will be loaded.

53
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,773
It will be loaded through routing.

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,410
The coach detailed component is loaded here

55
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,463
on this path.

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,970
Therefore, theoretically, it wouldn't get any props at all.

57
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,450
The router loads it and the router by default

58
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,520
passes no props.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,870
But you learned in the routing module

60
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,060
that by adding props true to the route config,

61
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,490
you can ensure that this dynamic value.

62
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,170
So the concrete value for the URL, which is then visited,

63
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,170
is passed in as a prop of that name into that component.

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,950
So here I named this ID and therefore,

65
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,760
when adding props true here, the view router will pass

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,760
the value ID holds in the end as a prop to coach detail.

67
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,163
And that's why I wanted, or I expected as a prop here.

68
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,780
And we can then later use that data, that ID to fetch

69
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,933
the relevant coach data from our Vuex store.

70
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,170
For that, I'll add a data option here where I add

71
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,890
a selected coach field, which initially is null.

72
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,140
But which soon will not be null

73
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,080
because when this component is created

74
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,970
using the created lifecycle hook,

75
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,090
I want to reach out to Vuex

76
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,440
and fetched a concrete coach data for this ID,

77
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,963
and then set selected coach equal to that.

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,030
So in created, I'll set this selected coach equal

79
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,773
to this dollar sign store getters,

80
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,100
and then go to coaches, so to the coaches namespace

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,280
/coaches getting all coaches.

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,810
But of course here I don't need all coaches

83
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,810
instead I'll call find and find once a function

84
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,300
where I go through all the coaches

85
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,500
and compare the ID of every coach to this ID.

86
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,030
So to the ID where you received as a prop

87
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,230
which is part of our URL

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,030
and if that returns true, that's the coach

89
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,740
which we ultimately return

90
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,923
and which we store in selected coach.

91
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,073
And that's how we find a coach in our coaches list.

92
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,470
Now, theoretically, this could of course fail

93
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,260
If the user enters this with a URL

94
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,050
that contains the ID of a coach we don't know.

95
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,680
But this is only possible if a user directly enters

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,800
this URL not through the links on our page.

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
And therefore if the user does that,

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,510
I'm fine with a broken experience

99
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,310
because that is actually not even a way

100
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,400
of using that app which I want to support.

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,520
So therefore fine for me to fetch

102
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,120
the selected coach like this, store it in data here

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,060
and then add some computer properties to make sure we have

104
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,070
things like the full name or the contact link here.

105
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,670
So here let's add full name where I return

106
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,003
this selected coach, first name,

107
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,050
plus a blank , plus this selected coach, last name

108
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,830
and add a contact link, computed property

109
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,830
where I return this dollar sign route path

110
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,810
plus slash plus this ID plus a slash contact.

111
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,070
Now, keep in mind we're all to referring to rate

112
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,070
and to areas here in our template and to description.

113
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,550
And currently these data properties don't exist,

114
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,870
we just got the selected coach.

115
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,230
So this should actually be SelectedCoach.areas,

116
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,380
or actually better use computed properties.

117
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,940
So here then add the areas, computed property,

118
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,280
for example, where I return this selectedcoach.areas

119
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,640
and add the rate computed property,

120
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,080
where I return this selectedcoach.hourlyrate.

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,200
And return the description computed property,

122
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,257
where I return this selectedcoach.description .

123
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,330
with that, if we now go to the details here,

124
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,360
we see the details for this coach.

125
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,640
So that is working and we see our different data

126
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,530
on the screen now.

127
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,270
So that's that details page ,

128
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,080
of course you can tweak the styling to whatever you want

129
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,780
but I'm happy with this.

130
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,670
Now it's up to us with what we want to continue

131
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,410
the register page, the contact page,

132
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,550
maybe the filter components to make sure we can filter.

133
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,430
I would say that's a good next step.

134
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,963
So I will continue with adding that filtering logic next.
