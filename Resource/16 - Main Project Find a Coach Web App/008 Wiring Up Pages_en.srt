1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,760
So let's add some dummy content to the other pages

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,110
and I'll continue with requests received,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,410
because we can easily reach that page by clicking

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,530
on requests in the header.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,480
And well we got no requests yet

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,530
so for the moment, I'll just output requests here,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,523
just so that we see that loading this works.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,280
So therefore we now see requests here.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,370
Now the other pages are a bit hard to reach at the moment,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,510
we got no links to get to the contact page

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,793
or to get to the registration page,

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,570
but we can at least add some of those links already

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,050
I guess.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,670
For example in the coaches list,

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,060
yes, we don't have any coaches yet,

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,980
but outputting the list of coaches

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,520
will actually just be a part of this component here.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,680
Let's say we will have an unordered list down here later,

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,860
but above that unordered list

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,840
I want to have a div,

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,860
so a different container here in the end,

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,900
which will give us CSS class of controls,

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,800
which should have two buttons let's say,

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,500
one button that allows us to refresh the list of coaches,

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,070
later we'll have coaches stored on a database in the web

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,960
and this button should then fetch the latest

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,670
snapshot of that data.

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,430
But besides that refresh button,

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,540
which we need,

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,650
we'll also have a button here

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,423
which should allow us to register as a coach.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,090
And therefore actually this should not be a button,

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,563
but a router link.

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
So here I wanna have a router link, register as coach,

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,570
which goes to /register

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,343
because that was our registration route here.

37
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,030
So this is our link I want here on the coaches page.

38
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,490
This one.

39
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,010
And therefore we can now also add some dummy code here

40
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,390
to the coach registration.

41
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,460
For now I'll just say register here,

42
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,640
but soon we'll add a form on this page,

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,070
which allows us to fill in all the details

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,293
we need to provide to register as a coach.

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,933
So now if I click this, we should see register at least.

46
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,790
Now we also have this contact page,

47
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,430
which we later can reach by clicking on the contact button

48
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,240
of a specific coach.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,390
At the moment we have no specific coach,

50
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,110
which is also a problem for the coach detail page,

51
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,200
which we can't reach for that reason.

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,550
But of course we can manually reach it

53
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,990
by filling in coaches/

54
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,680
and then some fictional coach ID here.

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,780
And if we do that, we would theoretically

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,510
reach the coach details page.

57
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,830
So we can therefore add a dummy template

58
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,453
to coach detail as well,

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,713
details for coach.

60
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,330
And if we save that, we should see this on the screen

61
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,433
if we reach this path here in the URL.

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,210
And with that, of course, we can then also

63
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,700
add a router link here, in that,

64
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,553
or on that, coach detail page,

65
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,980
where we say contact, where I wanna go to, /coaches,

66
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,050
then the ID, which later will be dynamic,

67
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,020
but for now I'll hard-code it, /contact,

68
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,460
because you might remember that the contact page

69
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,650
was this nested child route here,

70
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,670
which we reached with coaches, some ID, /contact,

71
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,050
and therefore that's just what I'm using here.

72
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,490
And if I save that,

73
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,380
we now have that link on the coach detail page.

74
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,093
And if we click that we reach contact here.

75
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,730
But what we also notice is that we reach it

76
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,940
but nothing changes on the page.

77
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,130
Well keep in mind that this is a child route.

78
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,120
Contact is a child route of that detail route here.

79
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,050
And the consequence of that

80
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,170
is that it will not be loaded to replace the route

81
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,140
that was on the screen previously,

82
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,280
but that instead it needs a new router view.

83
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,720
It needs a separate router view,

84
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,970
which has to be inside of the parent component

85
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,600
of the child route.

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,220
So in this case, in the coach detail component.

87
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,089
We need to add a router view there.

88
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,930
So here we can add a router view

89
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,440
and that's where then the child routes of coach detail

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,140
will be loaded, in this case, the only child route we have,

91
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,320
which is this contact route.

92
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,540
So with that if we now also add some dummy content

93
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,640
to contact coach,

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,090
contact a coach or anything like that,

95
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,090
you see that this now shows up here if we are on /contact.

96
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,410
If we are on just /c1 it's not there,

97
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,403
if you click contact it is there.

98
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,900
And with that we can reach all the routes

99
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,530
and we can see some dummy content on those pages.

100
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,850
But of course we're not just there for dummy content only.

101
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,130
So therefore why don't we as a next step,

102
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,690
add Vuex so that we at least have a list of dummy coaches,

103
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,620
which we can display and start working with

104
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,050
before we then later add the functionality

105
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,993
to add our own coach data.
