1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,070
Now for the not found page,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,800
I will keep this very simple.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,380
We can add a template here

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,310
and then maybe use the base card

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,430
to have our base container.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,500
And maybe also wrap

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
this in a section element here just for semantics.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,190
And then in the base card,

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,190
have an h2 tag where we say page not found

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,240
and below that maybe a paragraph

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,840
where we simply say this page could not be found,

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,030
maybe check out all our coaches.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,640
And now coaches should become a link,

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,990
so we can wrap this with router link here

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,917
and point at to slash coaches here like this.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,310
And if we do that

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,630
and we now enter any URL,

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,300
which is not supported,

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,250
we see that not found page,

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,910
and we can go back to coaches there.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,300
And that's already it.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,193
That is to not found page added.

23
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,190
With that though, we built a very nice project

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,760
where we see a lot of core Vue

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,930
concepts working together.

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,510
We got a bunch of components,

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,680
we got routings, we got animations,

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,360
and we are of course also using Vue.js

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,053
to manage all our state and our data.

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,180
I showed you a bunch of different approaches

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,890
and concepts you can use in your projects as well.

32
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,160
But of course as always practice makes perfect

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,710
and what works for me or what I like

34
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,200
might not be useful for you in your next project.

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,870
But you should have a very good idea

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,410
of how Vue works,

37
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,400
how Vue components work together

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,270
and how you build Vue apps by now.

39
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,430
Now we still got more in this course.

40
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,320
We got an entire new feature

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,260
to Composition API into which I'll dive later.

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,740
But for this project I also got more.

43
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,770
I want to add authentication,

44
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,440
so that we don't have to work

45
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,670
with this dummy ID, which we assume,

46
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,259
but that we have real user IDs.

47
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,930
We'll cover that in the authentication module.

48
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,810
But by now you already learned a lot about Vue

49
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,223
and you'll learn how to apply that knowledge.
