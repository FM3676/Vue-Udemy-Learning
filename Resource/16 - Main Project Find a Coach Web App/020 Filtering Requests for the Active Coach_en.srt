00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:03,600
[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] So in order to make sure,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,020
that we only see requests that are for us.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,605
So, for this userId in the end,

4
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:12,570
we can go to our requests getters,

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,949
and here on the requests, which we're,

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,150
fetching.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,010
I no longer wanna get all requests,

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,490
but instead I wanna filter,

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,129
for requests that have our ID as a coachId.

10
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:29,280
So therefore we can utilize the fact that in a getter,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,659
we can take more than just one argument, besides the state,

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,640
we can get access to our getters,

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,890
then also to the root state, and to root getters.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,760
And the root getters are what I need here,

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,520
because the userId is part of the root store.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,930
And there we have a userId getter already.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,890
That's the getter which will be useful now.

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,040
Here we get the coachId,

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,837
by reaching out to rootGetters.userId,

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,069
that's the getter name.

21
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,050
And then here, we wanna filter the requests,

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,380
which we got, and go through all the requests,

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,080
and check if the request coachId,

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,020
is equal to the coachId we extracted here.

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,970
And only these requests are then the requests,

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,383
that are returned here.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,860
This also means that we should change hasRequests,

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,160
and not check all requests in our state, but instead,

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,700
simply use,

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,860
our, requests,

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,070
getter here,

32
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,400
by reaching out to getters.requests,

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
so that we check the filtered requests,

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,713
and not all requests.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,050
Now as before I'll replace the unused arguments with,

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,583
underscores here,

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,370
but now we should have a set up,

38
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,500
where we really only see the, requests made to us,

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,363
as a coach.

40
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,240
So if you save this, if I reload,

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,910
and I send the request to the first coach,

42
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,383
which is not us,

43
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,449
we don't see this here.

44
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,163
If I now register as a coach though,

45
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,683
I am a coach,

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,370
and I then send a message to me,

47
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,500
which of course doesn't make too much sense,

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,353
but for the moment, that's the only way we can do it.

49
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,270
If I send this, we should now see that request.

50
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,870
And we don't,

51
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,170
and the error actually is quite subtle,

52
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,080
and a bit hard to spot, or actually it's easy to spot,

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,913
as soon as you console log,

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,620
all requests, for example,

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,180
to see what's inside there.

56
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,020
If you do that, you'll notice one important thing.

57
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,603
If you contact a coach,

58
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,940
and we then inspect the logged getter,

59
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,080
we see that the coachId is undefined.

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,960
And that's the problem.

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,610
That of course ensures that we're not able to filter.

62
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,370
Now it's undefined because in contact coach,

63
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,200
where I set to coachId,

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,474
where I get it from the route, I access this routeId.

65
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:24,070
Well that's incorrect, this should be this route.parans.id.

66
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,453
That's the correct way of getting access here.

67
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,690
So now with that done,

68
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,690
if I go back, and I send a message here,

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,680
to the first coach.

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,563
This is a test,

71
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,640
it still doesn't show up here under requests as it should.

72
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,670
But if we now register as a coach, again,

73
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,693
and soon we won't have to do this over and over again.

74
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,550
Soon we're going to add a backend,

75
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,950
and then the data will be stored permanently.

76
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,120
But for the moment we have to register,

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,893
and if I now sent myself a message here.

78
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,653
This is a test.

79
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,610
Now, we do see this message, and only this message,

80
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,610
here under requests received.

81
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,450
So now that filtering part is also working,

82
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,450
and with that indeed, the entire app is kind of finished,

83
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,387
but of course only in this dummy (mumbles).

84
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,680
One important thing is missing.

85
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,970
And that's a real backend where we store our coaches,

86
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,770
and where we store our requests.

87
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,020
And where we then of course also fetch the data from.

88
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,911
So that is what I wanna work on together with you,

89
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:42,703
in the next lectures.
