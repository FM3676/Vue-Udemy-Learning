1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,520
So as mentioned, I wanna get started adding some data.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,320
And we're going to use Vuex for managing that data,

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,060
because it will not just be static data,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,630
which never changes,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,230
but obviously we'll be able to add coaches.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,200
After all we will be able to register as one.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,920
And we'll also be able to send requests ends on.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,220
And that's why we already installed Vuex.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,710
Hence I'll add a store folder

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,750
next to my pages and components folders.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,620
And then that store folder,

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,570
I'll add a index js file,

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,890
where we set up the store in general.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,510
But I also wanna work with modules here,

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,780
because we have two main features, coaches and requests,

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,640
and I'll make each feature and the state and actions

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,840
that belong to this feature, a module.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,510
Hence, I'll add a modules folder in there.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,280
And now it's up to you how you wanna split that code.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,280
One file for the entire module or multiple files per module.

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,349
And I'm really just to show you different approaches,

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,630
I'll go with multiple files per module.

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,120
So I'll add another sub folder here,

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,210
coaches and a second sub folder next to coaches,

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,733
which is requests.

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,130
And now we're going to start with some coach data.

27
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,800
So here I'll add a index js file inside of coaches.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,550
This is the file where we will merge all the coach related

29
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,343
mutations actions, getters ends on together.

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,730
And then we'll have a mutations js file,

31
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,250
a actions js file, a getters JS file.

32
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,710
And we then split our logic across those files.

33
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,470
This may be overkill. This is not something you have to do.

34
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,120
But again, my idea with this course

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,110
is that I also show you different ways of doing something.

36
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,370
So therefore now here in index js,

37
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,260
inside of the coaches module,

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,440
I'll export an object which will hold

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,560
all the coach related state and so on.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,530
And therefore here will have some state,

41
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,729
but will also have mutations,

42
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,060
which I import from the mutations file.

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,750
So import mutations from ./mutations js

44
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,930
and assign mutations to mutations here.

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,480
And since key name is similar to value name here,

46
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,470
we can use this JavaScript shorthand

47
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,620
I showed you a couple of times already

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,250
where we merged just like that.

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,923
Simply to write less code.

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,199
And I'll do the same now with actions,

51
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,360
which I import from actions js

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
and import getters

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,640
from ./getters js like this,

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,040
and also add those to this module object.

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,820
So then we have actions and getters in there as well.

56
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,860
And now we export this module

57
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,160
to merge it into our main store,

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,193
which we have yet to create.

59
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,340
So in the index js file in the store folder.

60
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,780
So this file here, I'll now import

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,350
create store from Vuex

62
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,490
and then simply create a store by calling create store

63
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,330
and I'll export this store

64
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,823
so that we can later use it in main js.

65
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,690
Now this store takes a conflict object, as you learned,

66
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,030
and here we can add the modules option

67
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,500
to then import the coaches module

68
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,500
from ./modules/coaches/index js in there.

69
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,160
Because it's this nested index js file

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,310
where we set up this entire module

71
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,210
and combined the mutations action, scatters

72
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,140
and state of that module.

73
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,470
Hence it's that file

74
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,910
where we combine it all which we import.

75
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,480
And then modules takes an object

76
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,549
and I'll give this a key coaches

77
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:03,363
and point at my coaches module here.

78
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,960
And that key will be important

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,550
because I want to use name spacing.

80
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,730
So in the index js file in the coaches folder,

81
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,668
here I'll add name spaced,

82
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:18,010
true to use this name spacing feature

83
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,142
I taught you in the Vuex section.

84
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,563
Now all those files were importing from mutations,

85
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:27,370
action, getters, they're all empty.

86
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,500
So here we should also export objects.

87
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,170
They can be empty right now

88
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,270
because we don't have any mutations

89
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,120
or actions or getters yet,

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,170
but you should export at least an empty object in every file

91
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,290
so that the imports here work,

92
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,083
and we at least have empty objects in our module here.

93
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,540
Okay, so that is the first step.

94
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,180
Now in the state here, in index js, in the coaches module,

95
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,540
I want to return my state object.

96
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,610
And in here the state should be that we of course have

97
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,713
a list of coaches.

98
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,440
And we're going to start with some dummy data here.

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,530
Now you'll find that dummy data

100
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,780
attached in the coaches js file,

101
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,800
which you can open with a text editor.

102
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,360
And in there, you'll just find an array full of coaches,

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,940
which will be my value for this coaches key

104
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,970
in our coaches state.

105
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,020
And here I prepared two dummy coaches for you

106
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,210
with some dummy IDs and data.

107
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,223
So did we have something on the screen right from the start.

108
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,920
Now, did we have a state?

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,310
I of course all the want a getter to get that state,

110
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,020
because as I mentioned in the Vuex module,

111
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,670
whilst you can directly access the state

112
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,220
from inside your components,

113
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,970
it is recommended that you always use getters and stat,

114
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,150
and we are using getters here.

115
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,310
So in the getters js file for the coaches,

116
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,800
I went to add a getter and that will be to coaches getter.

117
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Let's say where we received a state we always do in getters

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,220
and where we then return state coaches.

119
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,820
So nothing too fancy,

120
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,420
no transformation or anything like that,

121
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,943
but at least a getter in place now.

122
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,920
I will also add a second getter already though.

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,640
And that's the hasCoaches getter.

124
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,830
Because later in this coaches list component,

125
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,620
I only wanna render this list if we have coaches.

126
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,250
If we have no coaches at all,

127
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,170
which will be the case once we switched to real data

128
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,610
away from the dummy data

129
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,750
and we haven't added any coaches yet,

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,230
if we don't have any coaches at all,

131
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,990
I don't wanna show that list

132
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,110
because it would be an empty list anyways.

133
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,990
So then instead I wanna show a message

134
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,853
like no coaches found.

135
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,780
So therefore I'll add a helper getter

136
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,600
where I simply check whether we have coaches or not,

137
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,260
and where I then return true or false.

138
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,260
So I wanna return to result of checking

139
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,680
if state coaches is truthy

140
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,690
and

141
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,973
state coaches length is greater than zero.

142
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,245
This returns true if we have coaches,

143
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,150
at least one coach.

144
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,483
And it returns false otherwise.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,050
And now with the getters in place, the state in place,

146
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,690
we can go back to main js and import our store here

147
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,920
to make sure we use it in this app.

148
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,800
So import from the store folder index js file,

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,190
and then

150
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,820
app use our store.

151
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,823
Now that Vuex store is part of this Vue app.

152
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,070
And with this, I'm getting an error, state is not defined.

153
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,280
I assume in my getters here, yes.

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,090
In has coaches I'm using state.

155
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,890
Of course, I should also accept this argument therefore.

156
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,420
But now with this, we're all set regarding that.

157
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,880
And we can now go to coaches list

158
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,670
and pull in our dummy data, our coaches.

159
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,040
So for that, we should add a script here.

160
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,510
And to reach out to our coaches getter,

161
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,370
and we do this with a computer property.

162
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,750
So we add to computed option here.

163
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,250
And there, I will now add a computed property,

164
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,840
which I name filtered coaches.

165
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,290
We are not filtering right now,

166
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,520
but we soon will be once we also added

167
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,180
this filter functionality.

168
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,970
So I will already name the computed property as such.

169
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,960
But for the moment here,

170
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,780
I just want to return this store dollar assigned store

171
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,020
getters, and then get the coaches

172
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,070
from this coaches getter.

173
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,110
Now, how do we get access to that coaches getter?

174
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,860
It's not getters.coaches because keep in mind,

175
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,260
this module is name spaced.

176
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,170
So therefore we have to reach this getter

177
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,123
that belongs to this module through its namespace.

178
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:07,770
And the namespace name is defined in index js here,

179
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,703
this key, which we set up here for this module.

180
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,400
So we get access to our coaches here through getters

181
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,400
and then square brackets, coaches/coaches.

182
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,900
The first coaches here is the namespace name.

183
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,793
The second coaches after the slash is the getter name.

184
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,400
This now gives us our coaches here under filtered coaches.

185
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,040
And now we can utilize them

186
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,600
to output our real list of coaches.

187
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,113
So here we can now render list items.

188
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,460
And with the four, we can go through to coaches

189
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,550
and filtered coaches,

190
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,410
bind the key to coach.id because every coach stored

191
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,283
in our store here has an ID.

192
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,533
And then of course,

193
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,340
I'll put whatever we wanna, I'll put for the second,

194
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,150
just to see whether this works.

195
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,730
I'll just interpolate coach.firstName here.

196
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,620
We will of course,

197
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,953
I'll put this in a different way very soon.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,230
If we now go to all coaches and reload,

199
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,073
we should see two coach names here.

200
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,170
And that proves stat Vuex is wired up correctly

201
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,450
and that we're able to access our coach data.

202
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,343
And that of course is a great first step.

203
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,050
Now we can also use that other getter we set up,

204
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,710
hasCoaches, to make sure we only rendered this list

205
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,430
if we have coaches.

206
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,140
So here on this unordered list,

207
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,460
I'll add a v-if check

208
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,110
and check if we have coaches

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,300
and I'll add a h3 tag below that let's see

210
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,750
with v-else on it, which is the fallback.

211
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,170
Whereas say, no coaches found in case we,

212
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,635
well, guess what have no coaches.

213
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,780
Now adding this year however

214
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,480
now implies that we need to have

215
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,330
a hasCoaches data property, or computed property

216
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,070
in this component, which we don't have yet.

217
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,000
So here in the computed of this component,

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,110
I'll add hasCoaches

219
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,260
because just having a getter off that name in Vuex,

220
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,130
of course doesn't do much.

221
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,240
It's not a way level

222
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,150
as a computed property in every component then.

223
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,660
That's not how this works.

224
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,670
So we have to add a separate computed property here

225
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,920
in coaches list.

226
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,990
And now here we can return

227
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,500
this store getters.

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,430
And then again, access coaches,

229
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,110
which is the namespace/hasCoaches,

230
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,360
which is the getter name.

231
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,790
Now with that, let's test this

232
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,850
and temporarily remove the coaches

233
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,170
here from our coaches array in the module.

234
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,523
And we should see no coaches found now.

235
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,840
And if I bring back those coaches here in the module

236
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,980
and save this, we see the coach data again.

237
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,220
So now that's working.

238
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,360
Now that dummy data is wired up,

239
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,890
and with that we can go back to working on our components,

240
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,193
and also improving the styling here.
