1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,510
Now I'll start with the data here.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,900
So I'll plan my data first,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,320
but this is just one approach.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,430
I'll then move on to the sign

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,240
of the components as a next step,

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,240
what do we need here?

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,200
Well, obviously we got these two main features,

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,480
we got the Coaches

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,920
and we got the Requests

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,370
so the messages basically.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,330
I hope you can read my writing here,

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,280
I'll soon start to draw and this will not be better.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,300
So yeah, that's why I'm also talking

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,900
hopefully we're all on the same page at the end.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,640
So we've got Coaches and Requests,

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,800
these are our two main pieces of data.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,590
Now we will probably need

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,340
a list of Coaches.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,440
So we want that

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,440
and we probably also need a list of Requests, right?

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,810
Because multiple Requests can be sent

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,240
also multiple Requests to the same Coach.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,650
Now every Request item of course,

24
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,430
should point at Coaches.

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,430
So a Request

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,230
will definitely be an important data piece

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,120
and a Request will definitely hold some Coach ID

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,380
because a Request needs to be connected

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,330
to the Coach to which it was sent.

30
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,120
Now in addition our Request

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,980
will need a message,

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,190
like the text that sent to the Coach,

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,340
and so that the Coach is able to respond

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,393
let's say a Request should contain an email address.

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,010
So these are the three pieces of data

36
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,720
I want to have in a Request.

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,100
And we'll have a list of such Requests

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,113
also as part of the application.

39
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,670
Now back to the Coaches,

40
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,320
what is a Coach?

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,290
Well obviously, Coaches are important.

42
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,910
A Coach will have an ID,

43
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,730
a Coach also will have a name.

44
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,500
Let's say we have a first name

45
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,200
and we have a last name here.

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,030
Now we can have more data

47
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,913
I want to have a,

48
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,510
description

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,270
where the coach simply is able

50
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,400
to describe him or herself

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,070
and I want to have a rate

52
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,453
so the hourly rate we would charge for a coaching.

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,790
Now that looks like a good set of data for me

54
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,180
and with that,

55
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,530
we should have the core data entities

56
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,120
to core data models we'll need in this app.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,490
Coaches and Requests and Requests through to

58
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,900
Coach ID are connected to Coaches.

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,040
Now that's just a rough data model.

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,420
You can definitely do this in a more professional way,

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,010
you can use what you maybe learned in university.

62
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,070
This is just a general plan

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,260
and that's how I like to start my projects.

64
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,150
I now have a general idea of the data I'll need,

65
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,940
and this will help me lay out VueX later.

66
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,210
For example, we'll probably have two VueX modules,

67
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,200
We'll have a module for our Coaches

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,723
and we'll have a module for Requests.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,640
Now of course data where planning data and planning VueX

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,700
is not just about planning the data we want to store,

71
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,020
it's also about planning our Getters,

72
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,430
our actions, our mutations.

73
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,330
So regarding the Getters,

74
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,020
it will be straightforward.

75
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,580
We want a Getter to fetch all Coaches

76
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,440
and a Getter to fetch all Requests.

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,030
Now what about the mutations though?

78
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,920
What about those?

79
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,230
Well for a Coach,

80
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,640
we definitely need a mutation to

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,150
register as a Coach

82
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,150
and we need a mutation to set Coaches,

83
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,250
which might not be obvious,

84
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,570
but when the app starts,

85
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,590
I want to load Coaches from a database,

86
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,250
from a web server.

87
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,900
So from a backend and from Firebase in this case,

88
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,410
and once the data is loaded,

89
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,230
once the list of Coaches is loaded from the database,

90
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,410
I want to set it in my local VueX store.

91
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,490
So these will be the two mutations I need for Coaches.

92
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,620
Now for requests, I need a contact

93
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,250
Coach mutation,

94
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,610
which basically sets or adds a new Request.

95
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,490
And I also need a set

96
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,410
Requests mutation here

97
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,150
so that I can set my Requests

98
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,300
once I loaded them from a backend,

99
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,150
because just like Coaches,

100
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,260
Requests will be sent to a database,

101
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,450
will be stored in there

102
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,520
and I want to be able to load them from there

103
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,150
and then set them through a mutation.

104
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,550
So when it comes to actions,

105
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,350
we basically have actions for loading Coaches

106
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,070
and loading Requests,

107
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,420
and we'll have actions for adding a new Coach

108
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,640
and for adding a new Request.

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,300
And this is about it regarding the data of this application.

110
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,220
Now let's move on to the layout, the components,

111
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,920
and also their routes where we are going to work with.
