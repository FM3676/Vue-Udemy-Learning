1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,070
So creating messages means storing data

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,990
in our Vuex store.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,090
Thus far, we only got our coaches module.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,430
Now, of course, we also need a module for requests

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,600
because we also wanna manage requests.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,110
So in the store, modules folder, under requests,

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,280
I'll create an index.JS fault just as I did it in coaches.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,520
And I'll also create all the other files,

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,520
mutations.JS, getters.JS, and actions.JS.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Again, it's up to you whether you want this layout or not,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,920
but I'll go for that,

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,753
also to be in line with my coaches setup.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,350
Now in index.JS here in the requests folder,

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,320
we then export an object and we import that object

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,930
from index.JS in requests into our main store

16
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,340
in this index.JS file in the store folder.

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,490
So here just as we imported the coaches module,

18
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,590
we can import the requests module

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,853
from modules, requests, index.JS,

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,960
and then simply add the requests key here

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,450
in the modules object in our store

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,663
and point at requests module.

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,210
Now, instead of this exported object,

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,640
I will now also set namespace to true,

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,830
so that we use namespacing for this module as well

26
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,220
and we don't just merge it into the global state,

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,230
into the global store, which we could do,

28
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,940
but which I don't wanna do here.

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,030
And then we need to bring in our mutations hands on.

30
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,510
But first of all, we need a state.

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,910
We need a state in this module, and that state should manage

32
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,290
one simple thing, our requests.

33
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,570
So all the requests we know, and then every request

34
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,480
will have a certain coach ID attached to it,

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,630
and then later, if that coach ID matches our ID,

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,600
that's a request we'll see,

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,363
all the other requests will be invisible to us.

38
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,180
So now that's our state and array of requests.

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,380
Now, of course, since we already are fetching data

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,400
for our request in the contactCoach component,

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,340
we now need a mutation and an action

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,450
for creating a new request.

43
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,560
So let's start with the mutation here.

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,320
Here in mutations.JS, we also export an object.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,010
And in here we can add addRequest mutation,

46
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,710
sounds like a fitting name,

47
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,593
where we get our state, like in all mutations and a payload,

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,280
which in the end will hold the request data.

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,460
And then we can simply reach out to state.requests

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,870
and push the payload onto this array

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,340
assuming that the payload already is the finished request

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,543
as we wanna add it.

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,940
And that's done already here for the mutation.

54
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,770
Now, let's add an action.

55
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,770
So here we export an object as well in the actions file,

56
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,650
and we could name this action, contactCoach.

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,420
Now we will get our context here and also probably a payload

58
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,900
because we need that data that was fetched from the form

59
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,743
in the contactCoach component.

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Then we can create a new request here,

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,440
which can be an object where we can add a user email field

62
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,610
where we point at payload email, for example,

63
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,330
assuming that the payload we get is an object

64
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,810
with an email field and add a message

65
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,233
where we point at payload.message.

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,790
But there's one more thing we need to add here.

67
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,090
And that's the coach ID because every request

68
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,470
needs to be attached to a coach ID.

69
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,630
So for that, I wanna get to the idea of the coach,

70
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,210
to whom this request was sent.

71
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,430
And therefore here, I assume that this is all the part

72
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,160
of the incoming payload, the coach ID.

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,130
And then we just wanna add an ID to the request itself

74
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,300
so that every request object has a new ID.

75
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,200
And we can simply create a dummy ID for the moment

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,079
by taking the current date and getting a string snapshot

77
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,183
of it, so to say.

78
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,010
And with that, we already got all we need.

79
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,010
Now we can call it context.commit, commit the add, whoops,

80
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,220
the addRequest mutation.

81
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,090
That's the name I chose here in the mutations.JS file.

82
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,800
And then also pass on our payload,

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,860
which for me here will just be this new request

84
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,963
we're building here.

85
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,810
And that should now add a new request to our requests state

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,513
if this action is dispatched with the appropriate payload.

87
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,610
So now it's up to us to dispatch this.

88
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,610
So back in the contactCoach component here in submit form,

89
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
we now wanna reach out to this store and call dispatch.

90
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,673
And then since our module is namedspaced,

91
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,390
it's the requests namespace we have to access,

92
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,600
and therefore it's the requests/contactCoach here.

93
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:24,830
ContactCoach is our actual name,

94
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,893
requests is our namespace name.

95
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,730
Now, of course, we need to add some data here

96
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,200
and that data should be this object,

97
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,440
which we're extracting here in our action.

98
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,150
So we need a coach ID, an email, and a message field

99
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,290
in our payload object.

100
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,970
So therefore here, I wanna create a new object,

101
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,280
which has an email field pointing at this email,

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,670
a message field pointing at this message,

103
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,920
and then one other important thing,

104
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,590
the ID of the coach to whom this message is sent.

105
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,480
And we can get does ID here because you have to keep in mind

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,500
that when we contact a coach,

107
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,283
this URL contains the coach ID.

108
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,503
So therefore, since this is a child route,

109
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:16,900
the contactCoach component is a child route of coach detail,

110
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,770
which has this ID parameter,

111
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,640
we can extract that here as well.

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,920
We could do it with Props to Route,

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,460
but to also see that other approach you learned,

114
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,160
here in contactCoach, I'll get the ID differently.

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,770
I'll set my coach ID field here to this dollars and route

116
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,370
and then ID because that parameter holds the ID of the coach

117
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,973
to whom this message is sent.

118
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,130
And that should then dispatch this successfully.

119
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,420
Now, last but not least,

120
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,430
I then also wanna navigate away from this page.

121
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,410
So we can do this with this router and then replace maybe

122
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,320
instead of push so that we can't go back to this page

123
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,400
thereafter and go to /coaches.

124
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,563
But it's up to you where and how you wanna navigate.

125
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,240
With that saved, we should now actually be able

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,370
to send requests.

127
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,210
So if we contact a coach here and we fill out this form,

128
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,410
first of all, if it's invalid, we get an error message.

129
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,493
But if I fill it out there after,

130
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,170
we at least leave the page,

131
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,473
but I get an unknown action requests/contactCoach.

132
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,820
Yes, because in the requests module,

133
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,930
remember that's a nice object I'm exporting here,

134
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,350
which I'm in the end importing into my store,

135
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,250
but what's missing here?

136
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,420
Well, the mutations and actions I defined

137
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,110
in those separate files,

138
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,380
I don't import and add them to my module here.

139
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,300
That's of course something we have to do.

140
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,630
We have to import mutations from ./mutations.JS

141
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,633
and import actions from ./actions.JS.

142
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,190
And once that's done, we can add mutations

143
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,610
using the JavaScript shorthand here

144
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,610
and actions as key value pairs to this module object.

145
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,760
And with that done, if I try to contact a coach,

146
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,550
this is a test, now we no longer get this.

147
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,250
We also don't see the requests anywhere though.

148
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,323
So as a next step, let's work on the requests page.
