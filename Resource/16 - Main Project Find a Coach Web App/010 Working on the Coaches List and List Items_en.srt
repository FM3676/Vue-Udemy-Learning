1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,700
So let's now work on the components

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,533
we need here.

3
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:08,060
And I'm going to start with the coach items here.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,210
For that I wanna use a separate component,

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,760
because we'll have quite a lot of markup and styling

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,260
related to this part, related to this list items,

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,230
and I don't wanna put that all into coach's list,

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,480
even though that of course would work.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,270
I mean, technically you can build

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,240
an entire Vue app with just one component,

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,500
but the idea behind components is to split your code

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,310
into smaller reusable pieces.

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,460
Therefore, in components,

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,120
I'll add a new sub-folder, coaches,

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,460
where all the coach-related components should go in.

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,053
For example, the CoachItem.vue file.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,430
Now, in this CoachItem.vue file,

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,850
I want to define my template, which is a list item,

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,570
or which holds a list item.

20
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,770
And in there, I now wanna output all that coach data.

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,530
For example, in a h3 tag, the name of the coach.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,170
Here, I will interpolate the full name.

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,540
And this doesn't exist yet,

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,740
but we'll add the logic to make sure

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,553
we will have such a full name property at the end.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,853
Then below that, a h4 tag,

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,820
and I recommend that you use the same tags

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,190
so that the styling which I provide works for you as well.

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,640
Technically, of course, you can use

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,600
any tags you want and any structure you want,

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,630
but here in the h4 tag, I wanna output dollar,

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,260
then the rate which we get for this coach,

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,763
/hour to show the rate this coach charges.

34
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,890
Then I will actually add a div here,

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,700
where I wanna output the areas of expertise of that coach.

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,710
Because the dummy data I gave you

37
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,570
already has this areas property,

38
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,220
which holds an array with some clearly defined keys,

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,170
frontend, backend, and career,

40
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,860
which are the areas of expertise

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,423
I wanna support in this app,

42
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,980
where a coach can be an expert.

43
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,070
I'm an expert in all these areas, of course.

44
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,243
Julie, for example, is an expert in career and frontend.

45
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,920
And I wanna output that here in CoachItem in that div.

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,250
Here, I wanna go through these areas

47
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,670
and render a batch for every area,

48
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,410
so to show which areas of expertise this coach has.

49
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,380
For the moment, I'll simply add a span here,

50
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,380
and add v-for on that to go through the area in areas,

51
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,350
so to go through all the areas of expertise of a coach,

52
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,990
add the key, which is the area itself,

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,850
because it's unique anyways,

54
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,850
a coach can't be an expert in the same area twice.

55
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,593
And I then simply want to,

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,163
for the moment, output my area like this.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,560
This will also become a separate component in the future,

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,820
but for the moment I'll leave it like this.

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,820
And then below that I'll have a div with a class of actions

60
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,330
where I wanna render two buttons in the end,

61
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,730
or two links, we could say.

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,310
One to contact the coach, and to, therefore,

63
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,900
go to this contact route,

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,140
and one to view the details of a coach

65
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,653
and go to this detail route.

66
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,563
So therefore here I'll add a router link,

67
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,850
like this, and on the first router link,

68
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,850
we're going to go to /coaches/ and then the coach ID.

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,170
So that should be dynamic.

70
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,240
For the moment I'll hard-code it though.

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,690
/contact and say Contact here.

72
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,780
And the second link will then show us the details,

73
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,020
so I will say View Details here,

74
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,563
and there, I wanna go to just /coaches/ that coach ID.

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,370
Again, I'll soon make this dynamic,

76
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,203
because, of course, the ID shouldn't be hard-coded here.

77
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,400
That's the general markup.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Now, for the styling,

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,300
we're going to use some scoped CSS style,

80
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,450
and attached you'll find the Coach Item CSS file,

81
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,750
which contains those prepared styles,

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,603
which you can simply paste between your style tags.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,990
And with that added, we can add a script here,

84
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,250
and now make sure that this coach item works.

85
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,700
The plan is to use this coach item in a coach list.

86
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,793
So we will receive all the data we need

87
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:39,830
through props in the end,

88
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,680
because we're going to render the coach item here.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,760
Here we have all the coach data,

90
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,140
so we can then pass the coach data,

91
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,680
which we need in coach item, through props.

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,080
And we would do it like this

93
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,050
because the data for a specific coach,

94
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,800
especially in such a list,

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,040
is of course not managed with Vuex.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,650
This is not application wide state or anything like that.

97
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,040
It's really just internal local state

98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,340
in this loop here, in this v-for loop.

99
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,483
And therefore that is a clear case for props.

100
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,460
Hence here we'll get some props,

101
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,420
and I want the ID of the coach,

102
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,830
we need that to construct this link.

103
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,693
I want the first name and the last name,

104
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,013
I want to have the rate and the areas of expertise.

105
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,730
And then we can add a couple of computed properties here

106
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,740
to make our life easier.

107
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,020
For example, for the full name,

108
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,343
which of course is a combination of first and last name,

109
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,780
for that, I'll add a full name computed property here

110
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,780
and return this.firstName + a blank + this.lastName,

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,930
but also maybe for those links,

112
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,590
which shouldn't be hard-coded.

113
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,257
Here we could add a coachContactLink

114
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,230
computed property, where we return

115
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,050
/coaches/ and then the ID.

116
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,820
So this ID refers to this ID prop

117
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,320
which we're getting, plus /contact.

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,090
This will then construct a path

119
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,090
like /coaches/c1/contact, for example,

120
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,370
and another computed property, the coachDetailsLink,

121
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,250
where I wanna return /coaches/ then again the ID,

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,080
but then slash nothing, because here we just want

123
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,733
to go to something like this.

124
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,100
Now we can also replace /coaches here,

125
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,810
if we want to, it's not necessary,

126
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,490
but to make this component a bit more flexible

127
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,800
in case we should ever change this /coaches path

128
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,467
to a different one, we can use this.$route.path

129
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:10,560
+ '/' to use whatever the current path is

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,683
as a starting point to then build a longer path.

131
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,690
This is totally optional,

132
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,570
but it ensures that if we ever change our path

133
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,570
from /coaches to something else in our route config,

134
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,870
we don't have to adjust everything

135
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,920
in this specific component.

136
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,620
So that's why I'm doing this here.

137
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,190
And now it's the coachContactLink,

138
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,710
which I wanna bind to to here.

139
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,697
So I wanna bind to with a colon to coachContactLink

140
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,900
and bind to here with a colon to coachDetailsLink.

141
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,350
And with that, we should have

142
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,783
a reusable coach item component.

143
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,813
Now back in the coaches list component here,

144
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,270
I will replace this list item

145
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,220
with my coach item component, which we just created.

146
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,280
But, of course, for that, we first of all need

147
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
to register this component, so that Vue knows it.

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,870
And of course it will be a local component in coaches list

149
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,740
because we only use it there.

150
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,530
So I will import CoachItem from going up one level,

151
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,550
going up another level, because we're in the coaches folder

152
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,790
in the pages folder.

153
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,200
And then diving into the components folder,

154
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,222
going to coaches, going to CoachItem.vue,

155
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,970
and here in this Vue components config object here,

156
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,970
we add components and add our CoachItem component here.

157
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,950
And with that, we can use it like this in the template.

158
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,330
And here, of course, we now want to loop with v-for.

159
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,907
So coach in filteredCoaches,

160
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,600
bind the key to coach.id,

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,380
but now all the paths, all the other props

162
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,810
which we need here.

163
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,810
So for example the ID, bind it to coach.id again,

164
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,330
then pass in the first name.

165
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,683
So first-name and bind that to coach.firstName,

166
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,790
we format that to make it a bit easier to read,

167
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,010
bind the last name, by the way,

168
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm using this Kebab case here

169
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,873
as I explained it earlier in the course,

170
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,893
and bind this to coach.lastName.

171
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,260
And then bind the rate to coach.rate,

172
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,260
sorry, hourlyRate, because on our coach data,

173
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,650
if we have a look at that in the state,

174
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,790
it's the hourly rate property, which holds the rate.

175
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,000
So hourly rate is what we have to access here

176
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,240
in coaches list.

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,403
And bind the areas to coach.areas.

178
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,530
And if we do that and save it,

179
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,850
we should see these coaches.

180
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,860
This is clearly not super beautiful,

181
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,363
but it is a start.

182
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,190
Now, to make this a bit nicer,

183
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,080
in coaches list, I'll also add some scoped styling

184
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,783
and attached you'll find a CoachesList.CSS file,

185
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,480
where you find two styles,

186
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,180
which you should copy into that style tag.

187
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,530
With that, at least the bullet points are gone.

188
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,460
But it's taking up the entire width here

189
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,440
and it's going from edge to edge,

190
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,970
even if I zoom out a bit.

191
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,060
And I would rather want that card look here.

192
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,100
I want to have these items in a box

193
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,900
with a light drop shadow.

194
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,920
Yeah, I want to have this typical card look,

195
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,320
which we also saw earlier in the course already.

196
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,890
And I want that card look

197
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,140
in other parts of this app as well.

198
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,610
For example, the filter should later also be

199
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,343
in such a card, and other parts on other pages as well.

200
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,030
Therefore, as a next step,

201
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,340
I'll build this card-based component,

202
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,440
which we can then use in different parts of the app.

203
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,273
And whilst we're at it,

204
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:09,610
we'll also build a button-based component,

205
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,300
because we have a lot of buttons,

206
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,670
and also links that should look like buttons,

207
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,560
like Contact and View Details.

208
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,633
And therefore, this is something that makes sense as well.
