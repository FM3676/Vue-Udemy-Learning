1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,110
So let's work on the validation of this form

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,460
because at the moment we can submit it

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,070
without entering anything

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,760
and that's of course not the idea behind this form.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,250
So in the coach form component here,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,360
we're fetching the input,

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,430
but now I wanna add an extra step when we submit the form.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,350
I also want to validate it

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,620
and for that I'll add a separate method, validateForm simply

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,750
to split the logic in two methods

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,510
and not have one super long method

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,200
and in submitForm right at the start,

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,433
I'll simply call this validateForm,

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,903
so this new method which we're adding here.

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,960
Now in here I want to go through all the inputs

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,150
and check whether they are valid or not,

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,440
and I will add an overall new data property here

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,310
to this entire component, the formIsValid data component,

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,210
which initially is true,

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,063
but which will be false as soon as one input is false.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,560
No actually I'll make form validation

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,500
even a bit more complex than just that.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,510
I also want to manage the validity of every single element,

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,580
so that I can later re-highlight the elements

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,380
by coloring the label red for example, that were invalid.

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,100
Therefore, the other data which has managed here

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,120
is no longer just devalue of a certain property,

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,290
but instead here that will be an object now,

29
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,590
where I want to have a val key,

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,190
which holds the value the user entered

31
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,140
and a isValidKey which initially is true,

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,343
which can become false if data input should be invalid.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,370
So I'm going to replace my values here

34
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,593
with that new concept.

35
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,660
Here val is null initially,

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,690
and here it's an empty array initially.

37
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,380
So now the data got a little bit more complex

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,550
and now we need to update v-model

39
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,530
and bind this to firstName.val, lastName.val

40
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,420
and so on because now first name, last name, description,

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,100
actually hold objects where we have a val property,

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,980
which then holds to value that should be bound,.

43
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,830
so that's why I'm updating my v-model bindings

44
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,533
for all the inputs here,

45
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,220
including the checkboxes of course like this

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
and now with that in our validateForm method,

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,620
I will go through all these inputs,

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,940
have a look at each of them

49
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,833
and see whether it's valid or not.

50
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,550
For this initially I'll set thisFormIsValid to true

51
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,640
in case it got invalid and therefore falls in

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,790
between since the last validation

53
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,300
and then I'll go through all these inputs.

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,100
The first one I'll check is the firstName.

55
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,020
Here with an IF statement I'll check if the value is empty,

56
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,250
keep in mind we're trimming it already,

57
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,980
so therefore excess white space

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,440
will already have been removed.

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,990
If it's still empty it's invalid

60
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,100
and therefore then I would set this firstName.isValid

61
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,690
to false and since the overall form is invalid,

62
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,940
if at least one input is invalid,

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,723
I'll set this formIsValid to false here.

64
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,823
And then we can repeat this for the lastName

65
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,313
and set this lastName is valid to false here.

66
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,500
And again, repeat it for the description

67
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,823
and set this description is valid to false.

68
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,840
Now for to rate the check is a bit different,

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,380
here I'll not check whether it's empty,

70
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,030
but I'll check if we don't have a rate, so if it's null

71
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,030
or zero or anything like that, or even if we do have a rate,

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,980
I'll check if this rate val is smaller than zero,

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,300
because you shouldn't be able

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,163
to have a negative hourly rate of course.

75
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,440
So in these cases, rate is valid would become false.

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,440
And for the areas I'll check if this areas val.length

77
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,050
is equal to zero which means no areas

78
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,530
of expertise have been added, that's also not valid,

79
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,600
you need at least one area.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,270
So in this case, this.areasisValid would become false

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,303
and this.formisValid would become false.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,120
So that's my validation logic,

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
that means that after calling this.validateForm,

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,620
this.formIsValid will be false if the form is invalid,

85
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,910
so therefore in submitForm I can check,

86
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,110
if not this.formIsValid

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,710
and in this case just return to make sure

88
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,330
that the rest of this method doesn't execute

89
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,783
because I don't want to continue if the form is invalid.

90
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,270
And now we can go to our template

91
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,590
and actually show users some feedback if inputs

92
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,520
or the overall form are invalid.

93
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,170
Let's start with the overall maybe, for that

94
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,673
before the base button I'll add a paragraph where I say,

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,820
please fix the above errors

96
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,110
and submit again or anything like that

97
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,879
and we only show this with the IF, if not formIsValid,

98
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,613
so if the form is invalid, if formIsValid is false,

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,430
But that's not all instead I also wanna highlight the inputs

100
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,410
that were invalid, so let's start with the first name.

101
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,000
There on the overall div I'll bind a class dynamically

102
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,390
and I'll use this object syntax for that

103
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,540
and here, I wanna add the invalid class,

104
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,210
which is defined down there in the CSS rules

105
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,200
to then change the label color and so on.

106
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,150
I wanna add that invalid class here on first name,

107
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,150
If not firstName.isValid, if it is invalid therefore.

108
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,773
Then this invalid CSS class will be added to this div.

109
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,840
In addition, below the input I'll have a paragraph,

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,840
where I say first name must not be empty

111
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,883
and this has shown IF not first name is valid.

112
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,950
Now I'm going to copy that paragraph

113
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,930
because for last name I wanna say this,

114
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,900
to say the name just with last name

115
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,220
and check if last name is not valid,

116
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,400
and I will also copy that class assignment

117
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
and assign it on this divv as well

118
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,780
but of course, checking last name is valid

119
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,483
or it not being valid to be precise.

120
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,670
Now for the text area for the description it's the same,

121
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,460
copy to paragraph and say

122
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,210
description must not be empty

123
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,800
and also copy this CSS class assignment to the div

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,900
by checking description is valid

125
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,750
and again, copy the paragraph over to the rate

126
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,860
and here, I of course wanna say

127
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,860
rate must be greater than zero

128
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,500
and also add the CSS class here

129
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,603
to the div if rate is not valid.

130
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,910
Copy the paragraph again and go down to the checkboxes

131
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,910
and here below all checkboxes, I'll also add this paragraph

132
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,140
and say, whoops here,

133
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,140
say at least one expertise must be selected.

134
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,280
and of course show this if areas are not valid,

135
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,290
I forgot this on the other paragraphs,

136
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,950
here I should check if rate is not valid here,

137
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,740
if description is not valid

138
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,860
and I did update it for first and last name,

139
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,290
but also now I'll copy that class here

140
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,300
and add it on that form control div

141
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,593
around the checkboxes if areas are not valid.

142
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,480
With that, we hopefully have some validation,

143
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,940
if I now reload and submit the empty form everything is red,

144
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,640
we got these error messages

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,313
and we got this main form error message.

146
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,679
If a reload again and I do enter something here and here,

147
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,020
but I have a negative rate here for example,

148
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,470
only the invalid values are marked as such.

149
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,470
And of course if we enter something valid in all the fields,

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,950
we are able to submit this but of course we get an error

151
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,370
because at the moment I'm still not extracting

152
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,230
the values correctly in my form data,

153
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,880
that's something we'll fix later.

154
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,000
Before we fix that, there's one other thing I wanna fix.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,290
If this is invalid, it would maybe be nice,

156
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,870
if it wouldn't stay red after we entered a valid value here,

157
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,950
it's a minor thing,

158
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,410
but I think it's a better user experience if as soon

159
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,220
as this was fixed, this would go away,

160
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,820
this red color and this error text

161
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,053
and therefore that's a functionality I also wanna add here.

162
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,560
For that, we can add a new method, clearValidity

163
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,720
or anything like that and expect to get the input name here

164
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,443
as a argument and then reach out to this input,

165
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,730
so to a data property, first name, last name, description

166
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,810
and so on, of that inputs some value.

167
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,380
So if input is first name,

168
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,040
we'll reach out to this first name.

169
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,070
If this last name we'll reach out to this last name

170
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,930
and set isValid of that input to true

171
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,930
and clear validity should be called

172
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,710
whenever an input loses focus

173
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,660
and for that on every input element in HTML,

174
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,370
we got the blur event, it's a built in event,

175
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,070
which is triggered whenever well, this loses focus.

176
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,250
That's when I wanna call clear validity

177
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,740
and in this case forward first name,

178
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,903
because that's for the first name input.

179
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,530
But now repeat this also on the last name here

180
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,900
also on the text area,

181
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,453
here it's description,

182
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,270
and also repeat this on the rate

183
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,930
and then of course is on the checkboxes,

184
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,930
so in every checkbox element, I'll clear areas, whoops,

185
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,870
copy that to all the checkbox inputs.

186
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,920
Reformat this to make it a bit easier to read

187
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,250
and with this, if we now saved this,

188
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,180
if I submit the invalid form, it's all red

189
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,683
but if I enter a valid name that becomes black.

190
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,690
This is a test.

191
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,180
If I enter something invalid, it also becomes black

192
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,110
because we have to validate again,

193
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,730
but at least it recognizes that we did something

194
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,830
and when I, I blurred something here it also becomes black.

195
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,540
Now of course, if I do have an invalid input here,

196
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,910
we still get an error,

197
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,150
but at least we give the user the feedback that we see

198
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,923
that he or she changed something.

199
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,010
With that though we got validation in place

200
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,320
and I'm happy with that.

201
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,400
Now, I just wanna make sure data is submitted correctly

202
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,570
and for that here in the submit form method,

203
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,710
we need to drill into the val properties

204
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,940
of all our input properties,

205
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,283
because that is where we store the concrete values.

206
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,510
WIth that though, if you reload,

207
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,460
if I have something invalid, we get an error

208
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,463
but if I do enter valid values here,

209
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,683
like this, this is submittable and we see our coach here.

210
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,240
So that's all working, as a next step we can move on

211
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,740
to their requests feature and make sure

212
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,420
that we've got a contact form

213
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,120
and that when we do use that contact form,

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,420
we send a request which

215
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,333
then also shows up here under requests.
