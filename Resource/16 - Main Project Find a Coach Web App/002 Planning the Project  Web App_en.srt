1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,230
As mentioned in this module,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,180
we are going to build the Coach Finder app.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,610
So a web application, a website built with Vue.js,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,630
which should help us find a coach that, for example,

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,000
helps us become better in web development, whatever.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,830
And for this website, this web app,

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,870
which we're going to build will have two main features.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,670
It has the find a coach feature,

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,490
and it has a feature to send requests messages,

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,290
to potential coaches which we want to contact.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,550
Now for the find a coach part,

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,750
we want to be able to list all available coaches.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,980
So all the coaches that signed up with our application,

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,490
we want to be able to view the coach details.

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,510
We will be able to register as a coach

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,120
and we'll be able to contact a coach.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,130
Now, the contact a coach feature also establishes

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,410
the connection to the other part of this web app,

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,200
the requests part,

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,620
we will be able to send such requests to coaches.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,580
And as a coach,

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,260
we can view incoming requests so that we then potentially

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,890
can reply to them.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,260
This is the app, the web app we're going to build.

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,570
And the focus of this module will, of course,

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,460
be on adding as many key view features as possible

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,140
so that you get a very good idea

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,343
of how building real view apps works.

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,380
Now for that, before we write any code,

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,800
we of course wanna plan the app.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,070
We want to have a clear plan on which code we need to write,

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,130
because even though we haven't done this thus far

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,120
in the course, since it's a Vue course,

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,470
this actually will be a major part

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,020
of any app you're building.

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,150
You need a plan, which then of course is allowed

37
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,390
to change over time, but you need an initial plan

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,280
before you start working.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,770
Otherwise you don't know which code to write.

40
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,010
Now there is no single right blueprint to follow.

41
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,120
There are tons of different ways of planning an application.

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,550
And here's just one possible way of doing that.

43
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,790
I like to start by defining the key features of the app

44
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,400
I wanna build.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,650
So in this case, find a coach and requests.

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,720
And then the sup features that belong to these areas

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,240
like listing all coaches, registering as a coach,

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,030
sending messages and so on.

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,210
Now, once the features are defined,

50
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,740
we can do two very important things.

51
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,520
The first important thing which we can do is that we can

52
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,760
derive the data we need, the data models we need

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,720
and in the Vue world data for the Vuex store layout we want.

54
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,980
We can plan our application wide state and our getters,

55
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,880
and also the actions and mutations we will most likely need.

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,770
Now from experience, I can tell you typically

57
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,410
you will plan something

58
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,480
and then once you start building the app,

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,750
your plans change and you add more actions

60
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,450
or different actions and different mutations

61
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,840
than initially planned because it turns out to work better.

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,510
And that is okay.

63
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,460
I'm not a fan of planning for days before you get started.

64
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,320
I rather get started quickly,

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,203
but a rough plan definitely won't hurt.

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,220
Now, the other important part,

67
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,450
which is not necessarily the second step,

68
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,070
you can also start with that other part

69
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,950
is that you derive to design, the layout of this application

70
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,280
and you plan which components you need

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,720
and how these components are related.

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,700
This also includes the part where you plan your routes,

73
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,970
which you wanna set up with the router.

74
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,313
So which different pages do you want to have?

75
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,990
Now, when I say design here,

76
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,620
I don't necessarily mean the colors and the font

77
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,270
or something like that, because whilst this,

78
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,370
of course, is a part often that will be done

79
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,780
by some designer for you.

80
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,250
I personally am not a designer,

81
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,980
so my designs look okayish, but not great.

82
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,190
I'm really talking about the Vue part,

83
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,452
so the components and how these components are related.

84
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,899
These are the major two things we wanna do

85
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,640
and therefore these are the steps

86
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,823
I'll start with in the next lecture.
