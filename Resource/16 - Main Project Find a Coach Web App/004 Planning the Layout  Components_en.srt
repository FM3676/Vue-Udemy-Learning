1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,140
So let's now talk about the Layout.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,510
And with the layout, I really mean everything.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,740
I mean components, I mean routes, everything.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,580
And let's maybe start with routes,

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,210
with the main page as we wanna have in this application.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,960
Now I want to have a...

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,300
Let's say slash coaches route,

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,750
which loads a list of coaches.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,750
So let's say coaches list components, something like this.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,110
I also want to have coaches and then some ID.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,210
So a dynamic parameter route where I load the coach details.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,480
So where we can view the details about a coach.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,023
And also some register route,

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,920
where we can register as a coach.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,597
So where we load some coach registration component.

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,500
And yes, I have a beautiful handwriting.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,070
So these are the coach related routes, which I wanna have.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,370
Now four requests, I want to have a contact route

19
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,143
where I open the forum where we can send a coach a message,

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,710
that could be the contact coach component.

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,400
And I want to have a requests route

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,290
where we view all incoming requests.

23
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,113
So that could be the requests received route.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,780
So we've got five main pages in this application.

25
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,080
Coaches list, coach details, coach registration,

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,720
contact coach, and requests received.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,470
And of course, every page here will be a component, right?

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,670
Because you load components with the view router.

29
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,500
Now that's it for the routes.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,060
Now what about the rest of the page?

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,280
Well, obviously if we would draw the page,

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,020
I want to have some header at the top

33
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,010
where we have links to the coaches list

34
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,230
and links to the requests

35
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,090
so that we can go to these areas of our app

36
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,120
through links in the header.

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,013
Now, if we click coaches, if we select this,

38
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,610
then on this coaches list page,

39
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,470
I in the end simply want to have a little list here

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,100
with the header of course.

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,450
Here, let's say with a filter

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,660
where we can actually filter by,

43
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,940
let's say area of expertise.

44
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,880
I forgot this when I defined the data,

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,260
I just came up with it.

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,800
But why don't we also add an area of expertise

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
to our coaches?

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,150
See, that's how I plan.

49
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,720
I start planning and then plans can change.

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,320
But let's say we also want to be able to filter

51
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,080
by area of expertise

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,780
and coaches should have areas of expertise.

53
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,010
Well, therefore here we have a filter.

54
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,270
And below that we then have our list

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,323
where we see the different coach items.

56
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,070
Now we can click a coach item

57
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,370
and we're taken to the coach detail page

58
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,200
where we see the name, the rate, the description

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,823
and where we got a contact button.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,460
And if we click the contact button,

61
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,450
we're taken to a number page with a header

62
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,720
and with a forum where we can set our email

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,400
and send a message to the coach.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,180
And this then leads to the requests of course,

65
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,210
once we sent this.

66
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,480
So the request is sent to the coach and can be viewed

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,430
on the requests area of this app.

68
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,993
So to say, and therefore, if requests is clicked,

69
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,810
I want to load a different page

70
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,160
where we also have that header, of course.

71
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,030
But here, I simply want to render a list of requests

72
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,030
where we see the email and then the message sent.

73
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,740
So email and message.

74
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,813
And then we can use that email to reply.

75
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,880
This is roughly how those pages should look like.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,860
And I hope it's clear what I mean here.

77
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,500
Obviously we're going to build this

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
from the ground up together.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,220
So at least then it will be clear.

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,280
And in these pages,

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,550
we're going to use a bunch of components.

82
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,900
We could plan all those components right now,

83
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,190
but I rather get started and then we build those components

84
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,850
whilst we start building pages.

85
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,250
For example, we will most likely use some separate component

86
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,110
for the coach items here.

87
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,030
We will most likely define,

88
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,640
a separate component the forums we have here.

89
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,070
So there will be a bunch of components included.

90
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,640
The header will, for example,

91
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,130
probably also be a separate component.

92
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,690
There'll be a lot in there.

93
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,140
This is the general plan I have.

94
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,700
I hope the general idea of the application is clear now.

95
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,533
And with that,

96
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:04,313
let's create the project and start writing some code.
