1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,020
Now I wanna conclude this part

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,980
of the project.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,500
So this main project without authentication

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,830
by adding some animations, some transitions.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,190
And there are a couple of things you can animate here.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,390
For example, the route switches when we switch from one page

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,443
to another page.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,330
But in addition, also the modal we're showing

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,240
if an error occurs, we can animate that in as well.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,850
And actually that's what I want to start with.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,850
In actions.ji here when we fetch coaches, I

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,840
will again reintroduce the forced error by using

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,420
an incorrect URL.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,190
And now we get this modal, and this modal just pops up

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,010
and is there.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,290
Of course this works, but having a little transition

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,690
can provide a better user experience.

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,240
And here since in the dialog

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,890
in the base dialog we're using v-if to show

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,290
or hide this dialog.

21
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,739
Here we need Vue's help.

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,570
Because we learned in the animation module

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,430
that transition the transition component Vue offers you,

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,150
can help you if you wanna animate elements that are added

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,533
and or removed with v-if.

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,940
So we can simply wrap this dialog with transition here.

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,470
And I'm only wrapping the dialog and not the backdrop

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,360
because I don't want to animate the backdrop.

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,040
So I will just wrap this dialog

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,550
with transition opening here and closing here.

31
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,183
Inside of that teleport component that works.

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,040
So I have to transition in here

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,570
and then give this transition a name, for example dialog.

34
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,330
But this name of course is up to you, as you learned

35
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,480
in the animations module.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,470
And now we can add a bunch of CSS clauses

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,780
that will be applied by Vue to the dialog

38
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,890
when it's added or removed.

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,270
So for this, I'll go down to the CSS code

40
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,270
and maybe here we can add a dialog-enter-from clause

41
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,630
to define the state or the styling we wanna start animating,

42
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,170
when the element is added to the DOM.

43
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,210
And actually set the dialog-leave-to clause,

44
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,920
to the same styles.

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,220
So that we make sure that we leave to the same styles

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,360
as we came from, when the element is added or removed.

47
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,320
And here I want to start with opacity zero or, go

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,430
to opacity zero.

49
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,530
And also transform it a little bit and scale it down

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,790
so that we start at a smaller size, or we go to

51
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,093
a smaller size when the dialog is added or removed.

52
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,940
Now the state we wanna reach when it's added or

53
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,780
the state we start at if it's removed, can be defined

54
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,780
with dialog-enter-to or dialog-leave-from, like this.

55
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,760
And here I of course I wanna go to full opacity

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,120
so that the element is visible.

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,080
And transform it such that the scale is at

58
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,520
the original scale of the element.

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,623
So that it's not smaller or bigger than intended.

60
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,960
And now we just need to in between clauses, which

61
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,530
would be dialog-enter-active.

62
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,210
And also dialog-leave-active.

63
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,210
And for entering, I will you set the transition CSS property

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
and transition all CSS properties.

65
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,970
So no matter which property changes, it will

66
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,960
be animated over .3 seconds with ease-out.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,550
And basically do the same for leaving, but there I

68
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,853
will use ease-in.

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,870
And with that we should have a nice animation,

70
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,250
a nice transition for the modal.

71
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,110
If we save that and reload, now you see

72
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,950
that looks a bit nicer.

73
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,120
Now we got this little animation here for the modal.

74
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,810
And of course you absolutely can play around

75
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,790
with the concrete styles, with the timing, with

76
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,392
whatever you wanna play around.

77
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,580
But that's now the modal.

78
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,760
We also of course can animate route switches.

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,840
And I covered this indeed transition module as well.

80
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,710
For that we go to the place where we render the router-view,

81
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,780
for the routes we wanna animate.

82
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,180
In this case I wanna animate all main routes, so not

83
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,450
this nested child route but all these main routes

84
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,660
should be animated.

85
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,740
And therefore, in App.vue we have

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,870
to use transition combined with router view.

87
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,950
And you'll learn that here the syntax is

88
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,850
a bit strange, maybe not what you're used to exactly.

89
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,790
Here, we need to pass something between the router-view tags

90
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,823
and that something is to build in transition component,

91
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,560
with a name of your choice route, for example.

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,640
And then in there the dynamic component component

93
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,870
which you bind, like this with is prop

94
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,150
which is bound dynamically to the component

95
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,363
the router decided to load.

96
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,390
And to get that component to router wants to render, we

97
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,780
have to use the slot feature view provides

98
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,090
with the v-slot directive.

99
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,060
And get the slotProps the router view sets for us.

100
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,990
And on those slotProps we can access .component

101
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,887
with a capital C and this is then pointing at the component

102
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:52,380
the router wants to load.

103
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,800
And now this will be animated.

104
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,500
We should also set the mode here on transition

105
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,060
to out-in, so that we first animation the removal

106
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,110
of the existing page and then the appearance

107
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,083
of the new page.

108
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,040
And as of it's up to you

109
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,080
which styles you wanna use here, with

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,900
how you wanna animate this.

111
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,830
I will define my CSS clauses down here

112
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,830
and that will be a route-enter-from, route-leave-to.

113
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,470
Here I'll not use the same rules because I wanna

114
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,790
have different styles, slightly different ones.

115
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,700
And we of course also need to route-enter-to

116
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,690
and route-leave-from.

117
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,700
And then also the active clause in between

118
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,700
so, route-enter-active and route-leave-active.

119
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,610
So now regarding the styles in enter from, I wanna set

120
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,600
the opacity to zero to make it transparent

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,050
and also use transform again but now with translateY

122
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,320
to move it along the y-axis.

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,490
And here basically start a little bit higher,

124
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,593
a little bit further up on the page than normally.

125
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,090
I will use almost the same styles for leaving

126
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,900
but here I will have a positive number for translateY,

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,293
to shift the leaving page down effectively.

128
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,270
For the active clauses I wanna use transition again.

129
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,810
Animate all CSS properties over .3 seconds

130
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,710
with ease-out and do the same for leaving but,

131
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,000
as before with ease-in.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,970
And then here for enter-to and enter-from, there actually we

133
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,020
can merge this into one rule.

134
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,560
So let me do that, because here I will use the same styles.

135
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,830
Here, I wanna have an opacity of one

136
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,830
and also transform translateY zero to move the elements

137
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,080
to the actual position it should have in the end.

138
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,250
Okay, let's give this a try.

139
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,970
Let's save this, reload and you will notice a warning.

140
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,190
Now actually we also still got this error here

141
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,720
so let's first get rid of that and let's then have a look

142
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,050
at the warning.

143
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,590
So here I'll fix that URL, so that we're not forcing

144
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,750
this error anymore.

145
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,610
And you'll now see a warning, and you will see

146
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,123
that animations are broken.

147
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,030
The reason for that is that, you are allowed

148
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,340
to have multiple root level elements

149
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,400
in your components templates.

150
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,169
But, if you plan on wrapping those components

151
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,690
with transition as I'm effectively doing it here.

152
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,929
I'm wrapping all those routes, those page components

153
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,700
with transition then the wrap components must only

154
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,940
have one root element.

155
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,240
And I guess this makes sense because transition

156
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,810
as I explained in

157
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,630
the animations module, needs exactly one child element

158
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,060
with some rare exceptions.

159
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,740
Therefore, child elements routes

160
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,860
with multiple top level elements

161
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,340
will not work with transition.

162
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,750
So to fix this we need to go to all our pages

163
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,360
and on every page make sure we

164
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,290
have just one root level element.

165
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,270
So here are two side by side sections, are not allowed.

166
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,540
So here we then need a div or anything like that, which

167
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,263
in the end wraps all the other elements in this page.

168
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,090
This is something we need if we wanna use transitions here.

169
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,820
Because otherwise we violate this rule

170
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,970
of having only one child element inside of transition.

171
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,870
So let's make sure we have just one root element

172
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,913
in all those page components.

173
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,750
Which is now almost the case I also need

174
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,420
to add one here, yep.

175
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,470
And now with that, NotFound is something we also need

176
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,880
to work on I just see but with that, if we reload.

177
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,080
Now we got the nice transitions here

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,033
if we move between our pages.

179
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,150
So, now we also added that

180
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,690

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,020
in the next lecture and then, we're done

182
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,963
with this main project for now.
