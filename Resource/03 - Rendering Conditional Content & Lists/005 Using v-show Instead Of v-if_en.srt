1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,760
Now there is an alternative to v-if.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,020
There is nothing wrong with v-if,

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,443
but there also is v-show,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,320
v-show does not work together with v-else or v-else-if.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,960
It only works stand-alone

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,870
and therefore if you have multiple alternatives,

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,760
you really need to use multiple v-shows.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,450
That's one difference.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,600
But what does v-show do then?

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,810
It seems to be more complicated.

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,520
It doesn't have to simplifications with v-else

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,640
and v-else-if.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,260
So, why would we use v-show?

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,810
There's one important difference regarding its behavior.

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,420
If I reload, we don't see a huge difference.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,450
It works in the same way,

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,000
but let me reload again and let's inspect this.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,950
And then you'll notice a difference.

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,790
The paragraph is there,

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,603
but so is the unordered list.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,470
And the only difference is that the unordered list is hidden

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,090
because its display style is set to none

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,670
and that's the difference.

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,670
V-if really removes and adds elements from and to the DOM.

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,350
So it really impacts which elements are part of the DOM.

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,930
v-show on the other hand,

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,573
just hides and show items with CSS.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,890
Now, which approach is better?

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,150
Showing and hiding with CSS means

30
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,090
that you don't have to add and remove elements all the time,

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,130
which can cost performance,

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,920
adding and removing elements can cost performance.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,100
On the other hand,

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,830
it also means that you have a bunch of elements in your DOM,

35
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,640
which you don't really need at the moment,

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,790
which also is not ideal.

37
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,920
Therefore, as a rule of thumb,

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,920
you should typically use v-if and only fall back to v-show

39
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,620
if you have an element,

40
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,980
which visibility status changes a lot.

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,750
So, if you have like a button that toggles an element

42
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,830
and it's switching between visibility

43
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,530
and being hidden all the time,

44
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,300
that is when you might want to consider v-show

45
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,120
in other cases use v-if.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,380
And that's why I'm going to switch back to it.

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,420
But I wanna show you, v-show as an alternative

48
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,870
because of course it is important to know that as well

49
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,890
for situations where you have content

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,283
that switches a lot between being visible and being hidden.
