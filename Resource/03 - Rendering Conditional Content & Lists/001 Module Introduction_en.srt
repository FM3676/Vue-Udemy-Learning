1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,040
We got those important basics now.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,790
We learned how Vue generally works

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,360
and how we can output content on the screen,

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,210
how we can react to user input.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,620
Now, with the knowledge we got thus far,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,630
we'll be able to build a lot,

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,350
but there are important missing pieces.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,120
And in this module,

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,150
we're basically going to dive into those pieces.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,630
We'll learn how to render content conditionally.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,760
So how to render some parts on the page

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,820
only if certain conditions are met,

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,700
and how to output lists of content.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,260
For example, a list of course goals, a list of products,

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,040
which should be rendered dynamically

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,410
and new items should be rendered when the list grows.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,500
Items should be removed if the list shrinks.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,540
This is what we'll dive into it in this module.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,620
Specifically we'll therefore dive into

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,160
how to render content conditionally.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,660
So which tools Vue gives us to make sure

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,180
that certain text is only shown,

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,730
if we got no products to be rendered, for example.

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,500
We'll then learn how to output lists of data.

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,570
So how to output a list of goals

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,340
or a list of products, for example.

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,220
And we'll have a first look behind the scenes of Vue

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,580
and learn about one important optimization

29
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,480
or one important feature

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,010
when it comes to outputting lists of data.

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,930
But let's get there step by step

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,713
and let's get started with conditional content.
