1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,310
Now in the module,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,770
we're just getting started with components,

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,370
and we don't really see their full potential yet.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,690
This will change.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,370
Over the next modules, you will learn all about components

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,800
and you will learn how you can build applications

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,250
like this one where the entire user interface

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,080
is built by combining components.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,250
And where we use components

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,170
to encapsulate different templates and logic

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,670
tied to that templates into reusable building blocks,

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,180
you will see how that makes it easier to structure

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,150
the code phase of complex apps and keep it manageable

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,730
by splitting your code, your logic,

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,790
and all of your templates and what's on the screen

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,390
into smaller reusable pieces.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,900
Now this is all code you won't understand at this point

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,290
but we'll get there, and we'll get there

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,293
starting in the next module.
