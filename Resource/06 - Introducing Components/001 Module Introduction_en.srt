1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,700
In the last module,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,890
we had a look under the hood of Vue.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,890
Maybe you skipped this module.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,430
That's fine as well, but if you skipped it,

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,000
be aware that in that module,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,530
I also talked about using multiple Vue apps

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,610
and I highlighted that those apps

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,110
would then not be connected, so that every Vue app you have,

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,230
which controls its part of the HTML page,

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,763
is totally independent from other apps.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,710
Now, we're going to take this concept

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,060
of multiple apps one step further

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,610
and we're going to explore Vue components,

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,960
another core feature built into Vue,

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,480
which indeed builds up on all the other pieces

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,970
you learned about thus far.

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,870
So this is an important next step, because as you will see,

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,320
components will now be there

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,920
throughout the entire rest of the course,

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,520
and components are a super important concept in Vue,

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,019
but also in other alternative frameworks,

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,120
like Angular or React,

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,250
just in case you ever want to explore those as well.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,640
In this module, we will therefore see

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,740
what exactly components are

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,360
and why we have this concept and how we use it of course.

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,970
And we'll start working with some components,

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,030
so that we get a first idea of what a component is

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,523
and what we can do with it.
