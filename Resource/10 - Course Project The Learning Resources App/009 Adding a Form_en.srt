1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,740
So let's work on the Add Resource screen.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,010
On this screen here,

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,350
I in the end, want to have a form.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,340
And I'll wrap that form into my good old base card

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,760
to have the card look around the form.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,390
And then we can add the form element in there,

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,550
the native HTML element,

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,280
and now add the different input fields which we'll need.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,280
That will be input field for the title of the resource.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,600
I also want to give it a label to make it clear

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,410
what the user should enter here,

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,580
and I'll say Title here.

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,760
And I'll give the input here, not just a type,

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,053
but also an id of title and a name of title.

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,340
And on the label,

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,180
we can add the four attribute and point at title

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,700
to make it a bit more accessible and make it clear

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,223
what we're referring to.

19
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,160
I'll also wrap that all into a div,

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,173
which will help me with styling later.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,740
And I'll give this div a class of form-control

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,090
because that is a CSS class

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,240
for which I already prepared some styling,

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,683
which we can soon add.

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,600
Now let's copy this entire div

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,720
because we need more than one control.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,770
We also need a control for the description of the resource.

28
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,780
And actually there,

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,270
I don't want to use an input element, but a text area

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,900
so that the user has a multi line input field available,

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,630
which makes entering longer texts more convenient.

32
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,490
So here, I'll set the id to description

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,130
and therefore also set the for attribute on the label

34
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,143
to description,

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,930
set the name to description here,

36
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,000
and set the rows attribute here to three,

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,823
to define how big this text area will be.

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,940
Now I'll copy the first div again,

39
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,160
because now I want an input again for the link.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,610
So here I'll set the for attribute to link,

41
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,160
the id to link, the name to link, and the type to URL,

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,860
which is one of the native HTML input elements types,

43
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,793
helping us with entering a URL here.

44
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,540
And now last but not the least, one other div.

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,420
And in that div we want to have the button

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,210
for submitting this.

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,210
So I'll add the base button, set the type to submit,

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,900
and also give it a caption, of course,

49
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,760
which will be Add Resource.

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,010
One short note about the type on the base button,

51
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,860
I added this type prop,

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,640
and I forwarded to the regular type attribute

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,710
on the button.

54
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,410
I did mention this fall through behavior earlier though,

55
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,100
and therefore we could actually also remove that

56
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,140
and remove this prop here,

57
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,010
and therefore just use the props

58
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,510
which we really added on our own.

59
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,990
And it would still work because this type,

60
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,050
which I'm setting here on the base button

61
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,050
will automatically fall through to the root HTML element

62
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,070
inside of the base button template,

63
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,460
which is this button.

64
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,463
That's just another note on that.

65
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,400
With that, I have to submit button in place though,

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,660
and now I want to add some styling,

67
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,400
which I, of course, prepared in advance.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,140
So I'll add some scoped style slots here.

69
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,560
And attached you find, Add Resource CSS file.

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,260
As always, copy the CSS roots you'll find in there

71
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,300
into this style tag in the addresource.view file.

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,023
And this will give us some nice styling for this component.

73
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,170
Okay.

74
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,230
So if we save this now,

75
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,760
we should see this form on the screen.

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,800
Not too bad, but of course, it's not doing anything.

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,280
And we want to ensure that the user is able

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,760
to click this button.

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,670
We then collect all the user input,

80
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,800
and then we add a new resource based on that input.

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,620
Now as before, definitely feel free to try this on your own.

82
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,380
We'll implement it together, step by step

83
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,523
in the next lecture.
