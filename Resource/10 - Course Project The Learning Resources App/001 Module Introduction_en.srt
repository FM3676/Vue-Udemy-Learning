1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,969
Throughout the last modules,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,910
we learned a lot about components

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,200
and therefore, of course, all about Vue.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,970
Now, it's again time to practice what we learned

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,340
and we will apply all that knowledge

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,220
we gained in a course project here.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,260
We're going to see components in action

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,940
and we're going to build a course project from A to Z.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,350
Now, this is the project we're going to build here.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,050
It's an application where we have two areas

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,930
between which we can switch here with our tabs.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,570
We got a list of our favorite learning resources,

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,570
including links on which we can click

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,000
that take us to those resources,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
and we can add new resources.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,030
And if you wanna get rid of one,

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,640
we can of course also just delete it.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,590
We can then also add a new resource.

19
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,590
You need to know how to Google, like this,

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,260
and it works, but if we decide to enter something

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,530
invalid here, we get an alert which you of course

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,630
then can confirm and fix our error.

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,270
That's what we're going to build

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,890
and whilst this application of course still doesn't have

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,210
20 different features, it does actually use

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,230
all the important features you learned about

27
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,830
over the last modules.

28
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,350
And you will get a good idea of how components work,

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,730
how these different features are used,

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,700
how components are combined,

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,500
and how you can build Vue applications

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,853
that use all those important features.
