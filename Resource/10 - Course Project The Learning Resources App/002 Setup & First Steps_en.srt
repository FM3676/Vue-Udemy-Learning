1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,730
Now to get started again as before,

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,890
attached you find a starting project

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,110
which you can download, run NPM install in there

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,330
in the downloaded and extractive folder

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,070
and once you installed all the dependencies

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,810
with NPM install, you can start that

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,470
development server with NPM runs serv.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,740
So basically what we did all the time

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,963
throughout the last modules as well.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
Now, we got a huge project to build

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,040
and as you can imagine, we'll also use

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,810
a couple of components to build this project.

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,910
Because, and I wanna really emphasize this here,

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,460
because that is what Vue and Vue projects

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,293
are all about, you could say.

16
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:46,293
You wanna build a user interface by combining

17
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:48,630
multiple components.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,460
And every component has it's clearly defined job.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,040
The job could be to just look good

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,290
and provide a certain styling and just

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,530
output some information or the job could be to

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,810
fetch some user input, show a warning if that

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,080
input is invalid or otherwise use that input

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,690
to generate some data.

25
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,490
And we are going to see all those different

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,690
kinds of components in action

27
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,510
in this module here.

28
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,210
Now how do we get started

29
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,400
with this kind of project?

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,590
Well, you might remember the monsters layer

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,950
project we built earlier in this course.

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,760
And there I also just get started step by step

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,440
by adding feature after feature.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,140
I wanna do the same thing here

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,370
and we can always split our code

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,440
into more components when we get a feeling that

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,760
a component is getting too big and we might wanna

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,260
split it up because that will also be

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,790
an important part of writing Vue code,

40
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,180
that you from time to time re-evaluate the code

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,370
and split it into smaller pieces

42
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,520
to keep it manageable.

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,162
Now was that enough of talking.

44
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:59,980
I'll start by adding a components folder,

45
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,970
into source folder because we will need that

46
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,990
and in the source folder

47
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,180
not in the components folder but in the source

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,100
folder, I'll also add a App.vue file.

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,130
Because we'll definitely need that

50
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,760
route component.

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,130
That route Vue application that will hold all our

52
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,653
other components in the end.

53
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,700
Well and then, I'm going to start by adding a

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,612
template here in App.vue and in that template

55
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:32,612
here, I want to start by out putting a list of

56
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,160
dummy learning resources.

57
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
Later the user will be able to add

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,520
his or her own ones but we'll start with

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,330
some dummy resources.

60
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,330
Hence we can start by adding an order list

61
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,670
and we can of course then manage those resources

62
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,670
here in the data property off this App.vue file.

63
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,870
So we can return our data object here and then

64
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,530
have some stored resources here for example

65
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,790
which could be an array, an array full of objects

66
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,403
where every object is one learning resource.

67
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,030
And in that an order list, we could use V4,

68
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,510
the V4 directive to output those storage

69
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,433
resources.

70
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,760
And that sounds like a good start to me.

71
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,240
So I'll start here by populating this with some

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,430
dummy data because for the moment,

73
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,520
we have no way of letting the user generate data.

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,750
And every learning resource should have an ID.

75
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,761
for example because we need that ID to add a key

76
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:38,860
when we use V4 but an ID will also be helpful

77
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,870
when we later add functionality

78
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,323
to delete resources.

79
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,350
I'll have the official-guide as an ID,

80
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,670
you can use any string you want here.

81
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,320
And then let's say every resource

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,230
should have a title, official-guide.

83
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,600
Because the official-guide,

84
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,760
the official documentation of course is a

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,930
learning resource, you wanna keep around

86
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,283
when diving into Vue.

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,730
We can then add a description,

88
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,600
because I also to output a short description

89
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,560
of the resource on the screen

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,190
and that description here could be

91
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:16,403
"The official Vue.js documentation"

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
and last but not least,

93
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,040
I'll add another field here, let's say a link

94
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,570
property which is to link to that documentation,

95
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,393
which is vuejs.org.

96
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,020
Now that's my first resource with which I wanna

97
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,030
start.

98
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,501
I'll also add a second resource here and that

99
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,954
second resource is Google because Google is

100
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:40,663
super important if you are learning anything.

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,580
Because you need to learn to Google.

102
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,860
There you will find all the resources you could

103
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,973
possibly want.

104
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,562
Okay, now we get two dummy resources here and

105
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,940
now we can output them here in our

106
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,520
an ordered list and I'm fully aware that this

107
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,160
is quite a bit away from the final

108
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,000
app we wanna build but we can simply get there

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,760
step by step by adding feature after feature.

110
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,990
So feel free to now output those resources

111
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,590
on your own, in list items and potentially

112
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,670
also consider creating a separate component

113
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,373
for every list item.

114
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,683
We'll do that together in the next lecture.
