1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,730
Now, there's one last feature

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,040
which we can implement here real quick

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,440
and that's related to the base dialogue.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,970
It works like this, but at the moment,

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,110
if we see that dialogue,

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,630
it is added deeply nested into our DOM.

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,270
It's somewhere nested in some divs

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,340
and whilst that works, we did learn about

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,510
a nice feature that can help us move it in the DOM,

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,590
and that's the teleport feature.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,360
So here in the BaseDialouge.vue file,

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,683
I will add the teleport component, which is built into Vue,

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,750
and that will wrap both the dialogue

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,970
as well as the backdrop with this teleport component.

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,860
So here's the closing tag

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,690
and now, teleport needs one prop, the to prop,

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,290
where are we add a CSS selector telling Vue

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,630
where this content should be moved to in the real DOM,

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,163
and I will move it directly to the body tag like this.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,090
And if we do that, everything works like before.

21
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,240
It looks like before, but if we inspect this,

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,120
we can actually see that now this dialogue

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,160
and the div for the backdrop is added here

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,140
at the end of our body section.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,910
And that's just a tiny thing, not a must have,

26
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,980
but since we learned about teleport

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,050
and since it helps us with our HTML structure,

28
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,753
why wouldn't we implement it?
