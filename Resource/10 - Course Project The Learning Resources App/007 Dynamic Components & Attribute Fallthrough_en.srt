1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,850
So as a next step

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,560
I want to allow the user of this web app

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,740
to actually add his or her own learning resources.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,300
So for that we need a form

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,660
where users can enter a title, a description and a link

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,920
and I actually want to give the user two buttons

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
which can be used to switch between this view here

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,350
where we see the list of learning resources

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,203
and that form which we still have to create.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,520
So therefore I will start by adding a new component

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,520
in learning resources, and that's the add resource.view file

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,350
which is the component where

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,910
eventually new resources can be added.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,570
And for the moment in the template

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,010
I'll just add a h2 tag

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,920
where I simply wanna say add resource

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
so that we can identify this component

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
when it's on the screen.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,220
Because I actually wanna start

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,440
working on another component first,

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,069
and that's the theresources.view component.

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,810
I chose this naming because we'll only use that once

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,290
in the entire application

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,590
and it will be a main entry point

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,400
of our resources area here.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,070
And the idea of the the resources component

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,800
is that in there we in the end have tabs you could say,

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,870
we got two buttons that allow us

29
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,060
to switch between stored resources and add resource.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,430
So therefore in that resources

31
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,350
I'm of course also adding a template.

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,550
And in that template, I now wanna have these two buttons.

33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,680
I'll actually wrap them in the base card component

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
because I wanna have that card look around the buttons.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
And in there we can add a base button.

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,060
We'll add two base buttons to be precise,

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,970
and so I'll copy that.

38
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,470
And the first button says stored resources,

39
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,380
so this button takes us to the stored resources component.

40
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,100
The second button says add resource

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,690
because that, you guessed it will take us to the

42
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,393
add resources component.

43
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,560
And how could we implement this now?

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,023
How could we implement this tabs feature?

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,510
We can actually use the dynamic component feature

46
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,640
you learned about in the last course module.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,450
So for that, in the script part here

48
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,130
I will add my data property to store some data

49
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,830
that belongs to this component only.

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,830
And here I wanna manage the currently selected tab.

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,810
Of course that name here is up to you.

52
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,500
And I'll start with the stored-resources tab,

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,780
but this can also be changed to add resource

54
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,200
and then I'll use that

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,433
to later switch between the two components.

56
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,390
So now I also want a method of course

57
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,250
which allows me to change the selected tab.

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,400
So let's add this methods option

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,740
to this configuration object,

60
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,930
and here I'll add a set selected tab method

61
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,180
where I get the tab

62
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,280
that should be selected as our argument,

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,783
and then we can set this selected tab equal to tab.

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,300
Now where should this method be called?

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,320
That would be our buttons.

66
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,210
So here on the first button, upon a click

67
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,460
I want to call this method.

68
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,090
So I will point at set selected tab

69
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,390
and tell you how to execute it.

70
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,760
Here you should then execute it

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,523
with an argument of stored resources.

72
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,680
And here for add resource,

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,680
I'll also add a click and set selected tab to add resource.

74
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,130
And now let's take a quick pause here at this point

75
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,080
because I'm doing something here

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,930
which we actually haven't done before.

77
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,170
And do you see what that is?

78
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,983
It has nothing to do with dynamic components.

79
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm adding a click listener on base button.

80
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,460
Well, on the one hand this might not be too fancy,

81
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,480
we added click listeners to buttons

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,340
for all the entire course.

83
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,170
But keep in mind, this is no regular button.

84
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,839
This is our own custom component,

85
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,600
why can't I add a click listener on it?

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,800
I mean, click after all is not a custom event

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,220
I'm emitting in there.

88
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,130
If we have a look at the base button,

89
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,830
this component doesn't emit any event,

90
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,060
and here on this button, on the native HTML button

91
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,663
there is no click listener.

92
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,280
This is actually a special behavior Vue has.

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,280
When you add props or event listeners on custom components,

94
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,150
then by default they fall through

95
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,170
to the root level element

96
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,633
in that custom components template.

97
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,010
So if I add any props or event listeners

98
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,430
to base button for example,

99
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,600
they will fall through and will be applied

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
to the root HTML element in base button's template,

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,710
which in this case is the native HTML button.

102
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,190
So this click listener here

103
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,190
falls through to this native button here in this template.

104
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,910
So it's automatically added to this button you could say,

105
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,760
that's happening behind the scenes.

106
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,530
And that's an important behavior of Vue.js

107
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,170
which I'm utilizing here.

108
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,860
Which we haven't seen before

109
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,510
because we didn't really have a great place for using that,

110
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,340
but here it's absolutely something that helps us

111
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,363
for wrapping this button.

112
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,460
So with that we can add this click listener here

113
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,830
and change the selected tab upon clicks on those buttons.

114
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,170
Now of course I don't just want you change that data here,

115
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,730
I also want to reflect the change in the user interface.

116
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,730
To be precise I want to render either the stored resources

117
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,520
or the add resource component.

118
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,590
And therefore below my base card here,

119
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,020
I'll now add the built in component, component

120
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,790
which is that component you use for

121
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,733
dynamic components as you learned.

122
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,690
And here we bind the is prop

123
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,470
to tell you which actual component should be rendered here.

124
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,910
So we need to pass the HTML element tag

125
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,850
off our custom component.

126
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,400
Now that's why I'm using my tags here

127
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,510
as selected tabs stored resources and add resource

128
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,550
that will be my custom component HTML tags.

129
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,693
And therefore here we can point at selected tab.

130
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,060
Of course this will now only work

131
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,410
if we register my own components here though.

132
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,430
Because currently add resource is registered nowhere,

133
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,040
and stored resources is registered in the app.vue file.

134
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,870
Now if we register it there,

135
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,620
it's really only available there in the template,

136
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,900
it's not available anywhere else.

137
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,930
So to ensure that stored resources

138
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,160
can be used here in their resources,

139
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,060
I'll remove it from here

140
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,330
because we'll not need it here anymore.

141
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,070
If we would we could register it there as well.

142
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,980
You can register a component locally in multiple components,

143
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,720
but we won't need it here.

144
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,920
Instead I now go to the resources

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,210
import stored resources here,

146
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,140
though I need to adjust the import path

147
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,130
because actually the stored resources.view file

148
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,590
is now in the same folder as the resources.view.

149
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,423
And then here in components,

150
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,540
I want to register stored resources.

151
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,710
And the same of course

152
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,780
for the newly added add resource component

153
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,710
imported from add resource.view.

154
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,173
And then register it here as a local component.

155
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,160
Now we'll be able to render both

156
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,540
but we'll have a couple of problems.

157
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,760
Now for one in app view,

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,610
I no longer can use this stored resources component,

159
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,460
so we should remove it there from the template.

160
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,370
But in addition, stored resources also wants a prop.

161
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,710
It wants this resources prop

162
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,170
which I use for looping through all the resources.

163
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,300
And now that we're using a dynamic component here,

164
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,059
I'm no longer passing that prop.

165
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,693
So how can we work around that next?
