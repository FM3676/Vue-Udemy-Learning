1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,260
To work around that we got two options.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,070
Option one, is that we pass our props,

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,290
to the dynamically rendered component.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,430
There actually is a syntax we could use for that,

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,860
and I did add a text lecture about this syntax,

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,410
in the last module, after D dynamic component lectures.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,970
But I'll not use it here.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,870
Instead, I'll use that provide inject feature

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,280
we learned about, so that we also can practice this again.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
And for that, I first of all wanna move,

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,080
my stored resources from App.vue.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,660
So move this key NDRA,

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,550
and bring it to TheResources.vue.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,450
That of course means that we can now get rid

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,970
of the data property, in App.vue,

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,533
because we no longer have any data in there.

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,370
But now in TheResources.vue, in this component,

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,130
we can add this key.

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,163
We can add the stored resources to our data here,

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,020
and now I wanna provide those stored resources,

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,940
so that in the stored resources component,

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,030
I can inject them.

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,600
And you'll learn how that works.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,110
For this, we can now add the provide key,

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,120
and add it in its method form,

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,600
so that the we return an object,

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,920
where we can provide our resources,

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,580
and point at the stored resources,

29
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,503
we have in our data property here.

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,480
And with that we're providing the resources,

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,210
to all lower level components.

32
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,340
So, to all child components,

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,023
and child components of child components.

34
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,060
And that means that in stored resources,

35
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,710
we now only need to change one thing.

36
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,370
Instead of getting resources as props,

37
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,223
we need to inject them.

38
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,410
So that we inject this resources key,

39
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,070
and that is the key I'm providing here,

40
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,490
and with that, we get access to those resources here,

41
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,943
just like that.

42
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,380
So now with all of that done,

43
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,270
I of course need to go back to App.vue though,

44
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,950
and use TheResources component we've been working on.

45
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,957
So import TheResources,

46
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:20,095
from ./components- learning resources/TheResources.vue,

47
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,010
and register this as a local component here,

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,240
in the app config object.

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,470
So that here in the app template,

50
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,557
we can render TheResources,

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,663
and hence surrender this component

52
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:35,423
that we've just been working on.

53
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,420
And with that if we reload,

54
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,670
here we got our tabs,

55
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,010
and we can switch between these two components,

56
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,193
and we see the stored resources there as well.

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,360
Now, let's maybe highlight which tab is currently selected.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,940
Because currently that's not easy to see,

59
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,540
and thereafter let's of course, work on adding resources.

60
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,110
But to quickly highlight these select the tab,

61
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,460
we can go to TheResources,

62
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,520
which is where we have these buttons.

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,770
And in there, I can set the mode,

64
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,483
depending on which resource is selected.

65
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,720
So I will bind the mode here of is first button,

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,260
which is used for selecting the stored resources,

67
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,740
and check if the selected tab,

68
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,030
is equal to stored-resources.

69
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,200
If it is, I wanna use the default button style.

70
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,120
So then I'll set the mode to null,

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,110
and not pass in any note mode at all,

72
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,430
but otherwise I'll set it to flat.

73
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,700
So that if the other tab is selected,

74
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,973
this first button has the flat style.

75
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,660
And since having all the logic here

76
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,380
in the template is a bit ugly,

77
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,350
though it's also not horrible,

78
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,790
but since I don't want to have it here,

79
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,340
I'll grab it and instead add a computed property.

80
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,210
So here, I'll add computed, the computed option,

81
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,953
and add the storedResButtonMode,

82
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,460
and return this result here.

83
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,633
Now of course, referring to this selected tab.

84
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,510
And we can also already add the addResButtonMode,

85
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,110
and here return this selected tab,

86
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,490
checking if it's equal to add-resource.

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,269
And if it is, we'll set it to null,

88
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,373
otherwise we'll use this flat mode.

89
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,203
And now we've got these two computed properties.

90
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,570
We can now use them in the template to bind to mode.

91
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,690
So here mode is bound to storedResButtonMode,

92
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,203
and on the other button,

93
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:40,280
the mode is bound to the addResButtonMode.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,923
To the other computed property therefore.

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,670
And now with that out of the way, this looks much nicer.

96
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,190
So let's next work on this add resource screen,

97
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,193
and let's make sure we can add resources.
