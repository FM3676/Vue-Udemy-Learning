1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,110
So we got our first components.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,640
Let's now work on the styling.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,950
Now there are some base styles

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,210
which I wanna set application wide.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,020
For that I'll go to App.vue

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,120
and there below the script tag, I'll add the style tag

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,340
without scoped.vue, just style like this.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,630
So the styles in here are applied globally

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,323
to the entire application.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,630
And as a side note, the structure

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,450
of having template first, script section,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,290
and styling last is the typical structure

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,630
you wanna use in those dot.vue files,

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,320
just in case you were wondering.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,850
Now attached you find an app CSS file,

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,680
which contains some styles,

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,940
you should copy between these style tags.

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,410
I'm importing some Google Fonts here.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,350
And then I'm just setting

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,820
some general application wide styles.

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,363
For example, applying the imported font as the default font.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,833
If you say if that and reload, we have a different font.

23
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,340
Now, I also wanna change the styling

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,100
of the learning resource, and therefore here,

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,440
I will also add styling, but now with the scoped attribute,

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,960
because the styles here

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,663
should be exclusive to this component.

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,680
Now you'll also find a learning resource

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,030
dot CSS file attached, and as you might be guessing

30
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,660
that contains two styles,

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,163
you should copy between these style tags.

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,760
And I'm giving you these styles for copy and pasting

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,260
because it's not a CSS course I know many students are bored

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,090
if we write CSS code here.

35
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,943
So here are the styles you can just copy them in.

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,070
And you should now see this on the screen.

37
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,900
Now obviously, that's not the final style,

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,933
but it looks a bit better at least.

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,740
To get closer to the final styling,

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,530
I'll add another component

41
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,430
next to the Learning Resource component.

42
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,960
That will be a component which should actually contain

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,960
this unordered list and then also this loop here.

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,540
And I'm creating a separate component for that

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,350
not because this would be so much markup,

46
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,100
but because I essentially don't want to have it

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,010
in my root App.vue file.

48
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,090
I really just wanna have a minimal template in there

49
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,050
and just have the application wide styles in here.

50
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,660
So I don't wanna start styling

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,350
an unordered list here in App.vue,

52
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,320
when we might be using unordered list

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,200
in other components as well,

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,443
since I don't wanna use scoped here.

55
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,350
So therefore, I'll add a brand new component

56
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,200
and I'll name it StoredResources.vue

57
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,700
add a template, and basically just copy the template

58
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,130
from the App.vue file,

59
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,900
or cut it into that template

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,593
of the StoredResources.vue file.

61
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,130
Now of course, we're now missing the StoredResources here,

62
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,470
which we need for v-for, the StoredResources

63
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,000
are still part of the data option of our app,

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,590
and therefore not available

65
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,463
like this in the StoredResources.

66
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,150
Well, you of course know

67
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,430
how we can make them available here.

68
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,010
We can add props here

69
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,820
and let Vue that we need some data from outside.

70
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,080
And here, I want to get my resources,

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,680
again this name is up to you.

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,733
So that here I can loop through my resources.

73
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,130
And resources should now be those StoredResources.

74
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,360
So in App.vue, I'll actually remove the existing import

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,653
which I had in here, and then state import StoredResources

76
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,350
from ./components LearningResources, StoredResources.vue

77
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:00,370
and register the StoredResources here

78
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,004
in components instead of LearningResources,

79
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:06,837
and then use stored-resources here

80
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,150
in my App.vue file template,

81
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,653
and pass the StoredResources I have here in my data,

82
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,529
through props to the StoredResources component.

83
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,110
So there, I wanna bind the resources prop,

84
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,013
which is the prop I added in there.

85
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,330
And I will pass the StoredResources key here.

86
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,800
So the StoredResources array I have in my data option

87
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,610
that's passed as value through the resources prop

88
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,793
to the StoredResources component.

89
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,760
And now inside of the StoredResources component,

90
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,010
we're using the LearningResource component.

91
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,070
So I wanna import and register it there.

92
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,820
And I'm working with local components thus far,

93
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,540
because at the moment, I only have components

94
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,700
that I need in specific areas

95
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,793
or in specific parts of the app.

96
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,350
So therefore, here I'll import my LearningResource

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,050
from ./LearningResource.vue,

98
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,350
it's in the same folder as the StoredResource.vue file.

99
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,390
So we just need this import path.

100
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,590
And then here, I'll add components

101
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,190
and register LearningResource as a LocalResource

102
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,053
in this StoredResources component.

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,020
Now with that it looks like before,

104
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,920
but now I got a brand new component,

105
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,940
the StoredResources component.

106
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,320
And I added this because now here, I can add scoped styling

107
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,700
to the StoredResources and add component-specific styling

108
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,240
that takes care of this unordered list

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,870
without affecting unordered lists in other parts of the app,

110
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,820
which we might have.

111
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,590
Of course, there would have been alternatives

112
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,390
to this solution as well.

113
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,420
We could have worked with CSS classes, for example,

114
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,950
but I want to keep my App.vue file lean as I mentioned,

115
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,120
and by adding this extra component, I'm achieving this.

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,170
Now, as I also mentioned before in the course,

117
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,860
things like that also come down

118
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,820
to personal preference of course.

119
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,340
I'm just teaching you one possible approach of doing that,

120
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,173
there is no single right or wrong approach.

121
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,710
With that, however, you can now download the attached

122
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,370
StoredResources CSS file,

123
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,980
and copy the style you find in there,

124
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,360
this unordered list style between the style tags

125
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,603
of your StoredResources.vue file.

126
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,950
And if you do that, you should now see a slightly changed.

127
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,460
Look here, the dots in front of the list items are gone.

128
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,543
Now it's still not the final look, but it's one step closer.

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,840
With that we're outputting some dummy resources.

130
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,650
As a next step, I wanna work on a header

131
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,750
which I wanna have in this application

132
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,740
and I wanna add a card look to my resources here.

133
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,550
And as before, you can definitely try this on your own,

134
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,350
come up with solutions for that,

135
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,650
for adding a header and a card look,

136
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,073
and we'll do it together in the next lecture.
