1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,220
Now there is certainly a lot of magic

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,630
in there at the moment.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,680
But the key thing is that with Vue,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,870
we just find the end result,

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,130
and we use these special features in the HTML code

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,130
to connect HTML to data and logic managed in the Vue app.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,700
And we will learn about a lot

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,200
of features Vue has to offer to us

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,990
which allows to build any kind of app.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,600
And being able to do this

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,880
and follow this declarative approach

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,400
where we declared the result instead

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,160
of the steps of getting there,

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,520
that allows us to build super large applications

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,680
without any issues.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,920
Whereas just JavaScript,

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,190
if we would have a more complex app,

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,910
would quickly run into problems.

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,180
We would quickly face issues there in bigger apps

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,200
if we would use just JavaScript,

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,570
and writing an application that's error free

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,800
and offers great performance would be difficult

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,690
with just JavaScript.

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,910
With Vue, it'll be easy.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,710
And in this course, you're going to learn all about Vue.
