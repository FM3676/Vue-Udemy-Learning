1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,900
So, in order to get our hands dirty,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,890
I prepared a very simple dummy project for you,

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,280
You'll find it attached to this lecture

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,210
as a zip file which you can download and extract,

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,900
and in that extracted folder,

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,980
you will find three files, an app.js file,

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,773
an index.html file and a styles.css file.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,730
Now, here, I opened this extracted folder

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,794
with Visual Studio Code, the code editor I'm

10
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,440
going to use throughout this course.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,752
Now, you can use any code editor or IDE of your choice.

12
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:41,060
You don't need a specific tool,

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,780
but, I strongly recommend Visual Studio Code,

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,370
which you can get for free from code.visualstudio.com.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,440
It's available for macOS, Windows and Linux,

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,640
so you can use it on any platform,

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,620
and you can simply download and install it from that page.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,950
And, once you did that, you can open the attached extracted

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,950
folder with File, Open and then navigate to that folder

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,090
and open it.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,700
You can close the welcome screen you might see

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,730
in Visual Studio Code, and if you want to get the exact same

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,540
look as I do, under View, Appearance, you can control which

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,460
sidebars are visible or not visible, and I only have the

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,160
sidebar and the editor area open.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,040
I, for example, don't have the activity bar,

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
which you might still have.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,880
I am also zoomed in here, and under Code, Preferences,

29
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:41,136
Color theme, I am using the Dark+ theme.

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,257
Now, you can configure this however you want,

31
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:46,860
but that is the style I am using.

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,120
Now, with that, let's start writing some code

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,200
and I will actually start

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,900
by writing some non-view code first,

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,079
so that we thereafter can see

36
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,683
why using a framework like Vue.js might be a good idea.

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,070
On this demo project which I prepared,

38
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,860
we can add Goals,

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,120
we've got a test goal at the moment,

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,216
and we will delete that soon,

41
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,010
but, now, whenever I add a new goal here,

42
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,864
like 'Finish the course'

43
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:20,380
I want to make sure when at 'Add Goal' is clicked,

44
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,835
this goal appears in that list down there.

45
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:26,730
In the index.html file, we've got some

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,420
mark up for that input field label button,

47
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,260
and then that list with the dummy list item,

48
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,100
which we can delete now.

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,250
And, I'm importing some styles which I prepared for you,

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,946
we don't have to care about those,

51
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:42,860
it's not a CSS course after all,

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,330
but we do all the import app.js,

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,950
and here we can write some some JavaScript code

54
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,270
to fetch the user input when the button is clicked,

55
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,890
create a new list item,

56
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,640
and add that to that list of list items here.

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,795
And, that's what I want to do first now,

58
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:02,870
with just JavaScript, so without Vue.

59
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,550
In app.js for that,

60
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,210
we first of all need to get access to the input,

61
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,570
so that we can read the entered value,

62
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,530
we need to get access to the button,

63
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,198
so that we can listen to click events on the button,

64
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,530
and we need to get access to the unordered list here,

65
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,160
so that we can add new list items.

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,490
Therefore, I will create three constants here

67
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,630
in app.js.

68
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,872
The first one is the buttonEl constant, lets say,

69
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:32,310
this name, of course, is up to you,

70
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,600
where I use document.querySelector

71
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,974
to select the only button we have on this page.

72
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:43,974
So, now, pointer to that dom element, to that JavaScript

73
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,300
object representation of that button element,

74
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,003
Is stored in that buttonEl const.

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,930
I'll do the same for the input element,

76
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,520
with document.querySelector ('input')

77
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,020
and also for the listEl with document.querySelector ('ul')

78
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,563
for unread list.

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,540
Now, we can add a click Lister with JavaScript

80
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,310
to this button by reaching out to the

81
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,290
buttonEl and calling addEventListener,

82
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,920
where we then listen to the click event like this

83
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,080
by passing click as a string,

84
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,603
as a first argument.

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,900
The second argument now needs to be the

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,270
function that should be executed when the click occurs,

87
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,564
For that, we can define a new function here,

88
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:40,543
addGoal could be the name,

89
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,607
which should be triggered upon a click,

90
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:47,140
so here we can then point at addGoal.

91
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,550
We don't execute it here, we just point at it

92
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,990
by repeating its name, so that the function

93
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,590
is executed for us when a click occurs,

94
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,710
Now, in this function we want to get

95
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,670
whatever the user entered.

96
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,640
So, we can get the entered value by

97
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,640
reaching out to inputEl.value, being an input element,

98
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,183
at which were pointing here, it will have a value property

99
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:17,120
that's vanilla JavaScript, that's built into JavaScript

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
that we have this value property on input elements,

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,975
where we then can extract the value the user entered

102
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:25,323
into this input.

103
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,670
And now, we can create a new list item element by calling

104
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,090
document.createElement which is a built-in method provided

105
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,890
by the browser, to create new dom elements programmatically

106
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,850
with JavaScript.

107
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,760
Here, we can provide 'li' to create a list item

108
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,210
element, and then we can use that newly created list item

109
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,570
element to set its text content, so the text between the

110
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,330
opening and closing text, of that list item, equal to the

111
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,383
entered value.

112
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,670
And then, we can reach out to the listEl, so to

113
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,670
our overall list, and call append or appendChild,

114
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,773
both will work here, I'll go for appendChild,

115
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:18,540
and append our list itemEl,

116
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,610
which we just created.

117
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,140
If we do all of that, and we reload I can add

118
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,230
'Finish the course!' and add this goal.

119
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,230
And thereafter, for example, also add 'Learn Vue!'

120
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,930
as a goal.

121
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,650
Now, let's say we also want to reset the input

122
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,900
once a goal was added, we could do that by, again,

123
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,830
using our inputEl and setting

124
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,080
value equal to an empty string.

125
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,240
This will set the value in the input element to an

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,200
empty text, and therefore clears it.

127
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,700
So, with that if we reload again,

128
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,080
and I 'Finish the course!', now this would be

129
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,650
cleared.

130
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,740
Now, that's just JavaScript, no Vue in action,

131
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,500
and it's obviously a very very very trivial demo website.

132
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,670
Still, we will now use Vue and you'll thereafter

133
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,810
see why Vue might be quite interesting, as it makes building

134
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,450
websites more fun.

135
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,860
I'll then also talk about the

136
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,840
differences between Vue and this approach,

137
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,433
but first of all, let's switch to Vue in the next lecture.
