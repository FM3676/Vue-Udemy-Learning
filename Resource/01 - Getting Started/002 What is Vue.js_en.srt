1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,630
So what is Vue.js

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,130
or just vue as it's also called.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,620
Vue.js is a JavaScript framework

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,370
that makes building interactive

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,660
and reactive web frontends,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,760
which are basically web applications

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,010
that run in the browser,

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,320
so in the end what the user sees, easier.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,350
This is a nice sentence

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,690
and it would be a correct definition,

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,590
but it might not be too helpful,

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,480
so let me make this a bit clearer

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,100
and let's highlight the important parts here.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,720
And of course, one important part is JavaScript,

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,420
Vue.js is for JavaScript and it uses JavaScript,

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,210
it's all about JavaScript

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,330
because JavaScript is the programming language

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,610
which we can use in the browser.

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,470
We can run it in the browser

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,160
after a page was loaded by the user.

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,630
It allows us to manipulate what the user sees on the screen

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,720
without fetching a new page from the server

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,360
and that allows us to provide rich user experiences

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,730
and I'll come back to this

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,270
rich user experiences point in just a second.

26
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,270
But it's not just for JavaScript,

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,800
indeed Vue.js is a JavaScript framework,

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,180
now what does framework mean?

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,210
A framework, not just in JavaScript,

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,260
but in any programming language

31
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,630
is basically a third party library

32
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,010
which means it's code not written by you,

33
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,660
but by someone else

34
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,960
which exposes certain utility functionalities,

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,160
certain methods, certain tools,

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,200
which you don't have to write on your own

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,510
and that's important, unlike a regular library,

38
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,010
a framework is a library

39
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,680
that does not just give you those extra functionalities,

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,490
but which also gives you a set of rules you could say.

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,530
It gives you a clear guidance,

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,530
a clear approach that you should follow

43
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,920
when it comes to building your application,

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,330
it basically gives you a clear idea

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,570
and structure of how to write your application code,

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,370
so it's the utility functions plus the rules.

47
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,039
Now, why would we use Vue.js?

48
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,979
We also have that in a sentence

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,240
because with it we can build interactive

50
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,250
and reactive web frontends.

51
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,130
Reactive is a pretty fancy term,

52
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,450
but in the end what it means is that

53
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,840
our app should be very responsive to what the user does.

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,330
If a user enters something on the screen,

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,430
we want to be able to react to that,

56
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,710
for example, to show validation errors below a input field,

57
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,000
we want to be able to show overlays with warning messages,

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,800
we wanna give a user a very modern look

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,710
and feel in our web application.

60
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,690
Often we try to achieve what we know from mobile apps

61
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,090
and I'll come back to that as well.

62
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,340
So we wanna provide a great user experience in the end

63
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,430
and Vue.js makes it easier for us to achieve that

64
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,540
and the web frontends part is all the important.

65
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,240
This basically means that Vue.js is involved with

66
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,170
what the user sees,

67
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,260
it's not a server side framework,

68
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,610
we don't use it with PHP or with node,

69
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,225
well, we can use it with all of that,

70
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,730
but simply in a combination,

71
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,080
but it doesn't help us write better PHP or node.js code

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,110
because vue.js is for the browser side JavaScript.

73
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,900
With HTML, CSS and JavaScript

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,490
and possibly Vue.js in the browser,

75
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,600
we can control what the user sees

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,210
and we can provide rich user interface in the web.

77
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,920
And Vue.js is a framework

78
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,310
that helps us with building such a JavaScript

79
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,640
driven user interface running in the browser

80
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,430
for our web application that might be talking to a server,

81
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,920
but it's all about the browser side code

82
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,513
that helps us achieve that.

83
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,790
Now why would we use something like Vue.js?

84
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,640
Why would we want this reactive web frontend?

85
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,370
Well, let's take a step back

86
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,060
and let's not think about web applications,

87
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,270
let's think about mobile applications.

88
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,160
Mobile applications are very responsive,

89
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,910
things happen instantly,

90
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,410
we basically have like one screen

91
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,860
where we add overlays,

92
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,279
where we render lists,

93
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,390
we can navigate to different screens

94
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,200
with a smooth animation,

95
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,270
it all feels like one unit you could say.

96
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,470
So mobile apps and also desktop apps feel very reactive,

97
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,420
we don't have to wait for new pages to load,

98
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,300
we don't have to wait for HTML to be downloaded

99
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,020
and rendered by the browser,

100
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,320
instead, the entire user interface is already there,

101
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,490
the entire user interface is part of the mobile app

102
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,630
the user installed

103
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,910
and the only thing that might be loaded behind the scenes

104
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,370
is data.

105
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,610
Now in web apps, traditionally,

106
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,980
we click a link and we wait for a new page to load

107
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,230
and that happens over and over again.

108
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,280
We might enter some data in a form,

109
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,410
we click a button,

110
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,710
that data is submitted and as a response,

111
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,840
we get a new HTML page.

112
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
So in a traditional web page,

113
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,163
we wait for responses all the time.

114
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,180
JavaScript can help us here,

115
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,460
JavaScript can speed this up

116
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,580
and JavaScript in the browser

117
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,840
allows us to provide a more modern web application,

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,350
a more modern user interface.

119
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,670
JavaScript has the huge advantage of running in the browser

120
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,360
on the loaded page,

121
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,370
that means we have a language running in the browser,

122
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,480
which can be used to change that page

123
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,920
without fetching new HTML behind the scenes.

124
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,260
Instead, we can manipulate the HTML structure,

125
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,620
the so-called DOM, Document Object Model

126
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,040
of a page with JavaScript.

127
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,790
And that means that in modern

128
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,460
JavaScript driven web applications,

129
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,290
we're not sending a request to get a new HTML page,

130
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,040
instead, we only do this once

131
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,800
and thereafter, we just exchange data behind the scenes

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,410
and we use client side JavaScript

133
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,700
and possibly frameworks like Vue

134
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,710
to update what's on the screen.

135
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,930
And we're using solutions like Vue.js

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,190
because just JavaScript may not be ideal.

137
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,320
Theoretically, we can build any kind of web application

138
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,910
with just vanilla JavaScript,

139
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,060
so with just JavaScript without any extra frameworks

140
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,580
or libraries.

141
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,660
No framework like Vue is needed in reality,

142
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,860
but it wouldn't be much fun to use just JavaScript

143
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,090
because we have to write all the code,

144
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,140
all the logic on our own,

145
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,060
we have to reinvent the wheel over and over again.

146
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,500
We might even write sub optimal code

147
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,680
and introduce errors and bugs

148
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,050
because we have to write everything from scratch

149
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,450
and we have to do these things correctly,

150
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,050
otherwise we might have poor performance or security issues.

151
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,410
Working in a team might also be harder

152
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,150
because not everyone knows our code structure,

153
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,970
the philosophy behind our code

154
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,800
and how to use our code.

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,230
And that's why we use something like Vue,

156
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,840
it gives us a clear rule set

157
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,300
in which we have to work,

158
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,930
which everyone in a team has to use

159
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,450
and we don't have to figure out

160
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,120
all the small nitty gritty details

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,900
like updating a part on the page,

162
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,490
instead, we can focus on our core business logic with Vue

163
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,380
and let Vue do the heavy lifting of updating the page

164
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,270
and of doing all the annoying stuff

165
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,320
which we would have to do otherwise.

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,400
That's why we use frameworks like Vue

167
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,750
and for the course, this will become obvious

168
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,970
once we dive into all the features Vue offers

169
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,170
and how easy those features make it

170
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,773
to build amazing web applications and user interfaces.
