00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,470
So now that we had a first look at Vue,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,990
let me quickly walk through what you'll find in this course,

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,950
to give you an overview of all the content in this course

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,480
and then we'll dive deeper into Vue.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,790
Now in this lecture,

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,710
I want to talk about the development setup I'll be using.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,060
I already mentioned that I work with Visual Studio Code,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,100
which is this editor,

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,994
which I would recommend that you also use.

10
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:26,230
And in there,

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,583
I showed you that I used the dark plus color theme.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,040
Now I'm not using any other special settings here,

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,380
which you should know,

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,341
but I will use one shortcut from time to time,

15
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,008
which is really handy.

16
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,950
So under preferences, keyboard shortcuts,

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,940
you can search for format document.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,020
And this shortcut,

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,990
which you can bind in case you don't have it yet,

20
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,930
will automatically format the code

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,650
to make it a bit more readable.

22
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,010
For example, if that would be indented,

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,070
it would work technically, but it would be a bit strange.

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,680
It would look strange, it would be a bit hard to read.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,950
With that shortcut, it will be reformatted.

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,180
And in case that's not working for you,

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,590
you can also go to View, Extensions,

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,410
to browse the extensions marketplace

29
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,510
and search for Prettier there.

30
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,050
And make sure you install

31
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,500
the Prettier Code Formatting Extension.

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,770
If you do that, once you install it,

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,660
if you reload, that format shortcut should work for you.

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,570
You can ensure that Prettier is getting used for formatting

35
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,170
by going to preferences settings,

36
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,790
and then there search for format.

37
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,800
And under Editor, Default Formatter,

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,753
make sure prettier-vscode is selected.

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,699
That's one setting I would recommend that you use

40
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:55,950
to have more readable code.

41
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,800
And that said, this is the setup I will work with,

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,440
and this is the editor You will see me using

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,590
throughout this course.
