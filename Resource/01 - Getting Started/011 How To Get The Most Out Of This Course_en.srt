1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,700
Now, since it is a huge course,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,870
I want to ensure that you get the most out of this course.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,060
And for that, I've got a couple of tips and tricks.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,890
Obviously I recommend that you watch the videos.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,890
It's a video-on-demand course, after all.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,170
Watch them at your pace,

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,120
and use the video player controls to speed me up,

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,510
if I'm going too slow or slow me down,

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,240
if I'm going too fast.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,660
In addition, I always recommend that you code along.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,380
Try things on your own,

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,080
and maybe pause the video and try writing the code,

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,070
for what we're about to add on your own.

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,590
And even if you don't do that,

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,250
pause the video from time to time,

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,060
to catch up with me to code along,

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,543
or as I just said, also code ahead.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,910
You might also need to repeat certain concepts

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,020
from time to time.

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,970
This is totally normal.

21
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,950
It's a lot of content in this course,

22
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,890
and therefore definitely feel free,

23
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,940
to repeat videos or entire sections,

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,600
if something is unclear,

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
or you forgot about a certain concept.

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,050
With the big course projects we have,

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,340
throughout this course, though,

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,610
you will also often get a chance of seeing

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,915
all the concepts you learn,

30
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:12,400
coming together in one project though.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,430
So that will also help with understanding these concepts,

32
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,193
and seeing how they work together.

33
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,800
Now, of course, sometimes you might also get stuck.

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,370
You might face an error,

35
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,410
or something might be unclear.

36
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,690
Two sources I recommend that you consider in such cases,

37
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,440
would be Google and stack overflow.

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,920
You will find stack overflow automatically if you Google.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,740
And I'm serious about this,

40
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,730
if you face some error message,

41
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,410
if something is unclear,

42
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,930
put it into Google and search the web,

43
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,450
often you'll find a couple of threads,

44
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,310
on that problem specifically.

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,210
And very often that will help you solve your problem.

46
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,680
But of course, if you don't find a solution there,

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,940
or if you are stuck, if something is unclear,

48
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,020
we also got a Q and A section,

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,430
in which you can ask and answer.

50
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,150
And I'm really serious about the answering part.

51
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,320
Asking is simple. Answering is hard,

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,289
but ultimately you will learn a lot more,

53
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,340
if you help your fellow students,

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,090
and you also answer in the Q and A section.

55
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,860
Of course, I'm also there to help you,

56
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,610
and I'll do my very best to provide quick answers,

57
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,570
on course related questions.

58
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,310
But definitely use this as a forum for discussion.

59
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,630
In addition, if you are facing errors,

60
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,900
if you got an error in your code,

61
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,050
which I don't get in the videos,

62
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,610
if you're facing an error,

63
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,050
compare your code to mine.

64
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,485
You'll find snapshots, code snapshots attached by me,

65
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:42,140
on the last lecture of every course module,

66
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,900
of every course section.

67
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,120
On the last lecture of every section,

68
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,770
you'll find code snapshots for the different lectures,

69
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,470
in that section.

70
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,950
And the attachment name,

71
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,450
will tell you to which lecture it belongs.

72
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,450
And you can use these snapshots to compare my code to yours.

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,680
You can also replace your code with mine temporarily,

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,520
step by step, to narrow down the issue,

75
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,150
and find out where your code differs,

76
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,480
and what might be causing an error.

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,550
And with that, you got all the tools you need,

78
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,270
to get a lot out of this course.

79
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,490
So let's jump right into the next section,

80
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,373
where we will start with the basics of Vue.
