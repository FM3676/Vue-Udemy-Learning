1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,460
So what is in this course then,

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,990
what does this course have to offer?

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,770
Well, a lot, this is a huge course.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,350
I completely updated it with the release of view free

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,830
and I'll keep updating it

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,260
and it has tons of content.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,010
We'll take a deep dive into view

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,920
and we'll start at the absolute basics.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,440
No prior view knowledge is required for this course,

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,490
and we will walk through all these important basics,

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,180
step by step.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,360
We will have modules, course sections

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,090
where we explore the base syntax, templates,

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,520
directives, working with data and methods,

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,970
computed properties and Watchers,

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,700
and you will learn what all these things are

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,540
and how to use them and how they work together

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,210
and this will give us the foundation so to say.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,040
Now we'll also thereafter explore intermediate concepts,

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,856
we're going to explore components

21
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:02,410
and component communication.

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,080
We'll take a look behind the scenes of view

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,230
to see how it works under the hood

24
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,200
and to understand its magic.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,090
We'll learn how to work with forums and user input,

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,280
sending http requests,

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,800
how to implement routing

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,130
and load different pages in a view app

29
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,910
even if it's a single page app,

30
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,880
yes, that sounds strange, but it will work.

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,590
We'll dive into animations with you

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,500
and we're not even done thereafter,

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,340
we'll also explore advanced concepts,

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,530
we will dive into working with Vuex for state management.

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,180
We'll explore authentication in view apps,

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,970
how to deploy and optimize your view app.

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,650
We'll have a look at the composition API,

38
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,890
which was introduced with view free

39
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,480
and when I say a look,

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,690
I mean a huge module

41
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,210
where we dive super deeply into it.

42
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,430
We will learn how we may reuse code

43
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,720
with and without the composition API

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,360
and that's really not even all,

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,070
there is so much content in this course.

46
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,820
But we'll not just walk through all these topics and theory,

47
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,240
instead, I prepared dozens of small demos

48
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,040
and mini projects for you,

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,980
which we use in the different modules

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,960
to learn about different concepts.

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,370
And we also got multiple bigger course projects

52
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,150
where we will start from scratch together

53
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,135
and implement all those features

54
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,930
in the context of bigger demos,

55
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,260
in the context of bigger projects

56
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,220
which are then of course, for example,

57
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,363
could also add to your portfolio.

58
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,470
In addition, you'll find assignments

59
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,390
and challenges in this course,

60
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,570
with challenges I mean that I will sometimes tell you

61
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,470
to pause a video and try something on your own and

62
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,180
you can then do that to practice this on your own

63
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,370
and overall you will get all the theory

64
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,490
and all the practice you need with this course,

65
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,963
it's a huge course with tons of content.
