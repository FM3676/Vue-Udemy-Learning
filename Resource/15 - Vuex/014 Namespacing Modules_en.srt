1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,460
Now besides this local state,

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,700
you can also make the entire module local.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,750
You can make it name spaced, as it's called,

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,560
to make sure that multiple modules

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,350
are clearly separated from each other.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,220
Now why might you wanna do that?

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,490
Well, as you're application grows,

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,320
you could of course have name clashes.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,210
You might be using the same getter or the same action name

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,190
in different modules of the same store.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,380
It's not the case here,

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,630
but if for whatever reason

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,410
we had a login action here, in the counter module,

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,650
that would be clashing with the login action

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,363
we got in our main store.

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,940
Because at the moment, besides the state,

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,963
everything is merged together into one object basically.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,680
So in bigger apps, you could have such clashes

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,680
and to avoid that you can name space modules.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,870
You do that by adding an extra option,

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,860
inside of your object here,

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,210
and that's the name spaced option

23
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,593
which you can set to true.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,750
If you add name spaced true,

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,030
you tell vuex that now the entire module

26
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,920
and not just the state should be kinda detached

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,483
from the rest of the store.

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,280
If you do that though, you will now notice

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,363
that our getters and our action dispatchers no longer work.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,340
Because now these actions and getters

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,820
are no longer available on the main store.

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,040
Instead now we have to access them

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,220
by specifying the correct name space.

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,763
And how does it work and what is the name space?

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,930
Well, the name space is this key you assigned

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,930
for adding the module in this modules object to your store.

37
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,660
So in my case, numbers.

38
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,350
That's the name space off the counter module.

39
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,820
And we now need to use this name space

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,790
to work with actions, getters and so on

41
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,363
inside of this module.

42
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,510
Now here's how that will work.

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,440
In favorite value, I access my normalized counter getter.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,800
Now you don't access dot normalized counter

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,120
but instead a special property name,

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,090
which contains a special character,

47
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,360
in which you hence have to access

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,630
with this square bracket notation.

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,090
You pass in a string here, your property name as a string,

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,330
and this property name is now made up of

51
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,700
the old property name, so normalized counter,

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,310
but prior to that, in front of that,

53
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,550
you have your name space.

54
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,593
So in my case, numbers.

55
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,570
So you have numbers and then a slash in between.

56
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,660
Might look strange

57
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,053
but this is now the property name of the normalized counter,

58
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,500
name space, slash and then your getter name,

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,220
action name, whatever it is.

60
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,620
In this case, it's a getter.

61
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,200
And that's when we now see at least one counter here,

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,040
it's this normalized counter,

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,590
which I'm outputting like this.

64
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,700
Now if you are using map getters,

65
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,063
you pass a first argument to map getters,

66
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,390
which is your name space, in this case numbers,

67
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,760
and then there after you still add your array

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,600
with the getter names as before.

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,520
So with that if we save this,

70
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,523
the second counter is back as well.

71
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,120
So name space as a first argument,

72
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,040
second argument is then still your array of getters

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,653
inside of that name space.

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,970
And the same of course for the other parts.

75
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,730
Map actions takes name space as a first argument

76
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,000
and then your action names as before.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And in app vue, here we're at dispatch,

78
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,480
where I dispatch manually actually,

79
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,793
the type is now numbers slash increase.

80
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,423
So again, name space slash and then the action name.

81
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,380
With that, all the buttons work again now

82
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,170
and now we're using this name space in the future

83
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,140
to detach our module and to make sure

84
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,170
that we don't have any name clashes,

85
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,050
which we of course don't have here,

86
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,983
but which you in bigger apps definitely could have.

87
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,120
And with that, we're merging a module with our main store,

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,630
we still have some global state in there,

89
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,460
the authentication state,

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,870
but we can absolutely combine it like this

91
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,230
and we're even name spacing our module

92
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,810
to make sure that we don't accidentally

93
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,540
trigger an action inside of this module

94
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,930
when we actually wanted to trigger a global action,

95
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,923
for example.
