1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,640
Now lets finish this up

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,193
by migrating is logged in.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,330
Currently we're managing it in App Vue

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,050
and that's of course not the goal.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,480
Instead, I'll manage this as a route state,

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,070
which is not in a module,

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,050
but which is managed ind the store itself

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,530
though, of course you could put it

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,623
into a module if you want it to.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,950
But with that we return an object here

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,800
and then there we got is logged in,

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,923
which initially is false in our main store.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,860
With that in App Vue,

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,823
we can entirely get rid of data.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,350
Now I got these two methods,

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,170
which I will now also cut

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,690
and hence, we can remove methods here

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,630
and add them as mutations instead.

19
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,630
So here we got the mutations

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,890
and in login we get to the state

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,750
and we change state is logged in

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,590
and set it to true.

23
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,423
In logout we do the opposite.

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,670
Now we also need actions as you learned.

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,670
So here I will also add login and logout actions

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,680
and we get our context here

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,563
and then context commit login here.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,373
And in logout, we do the same with the log out mutation.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,030
And then we can add a getter

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,080
is authenticated could be together name,

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,340
the name is up to you of course.

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,150
Here we also get our state

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,870
and then we return state is logged in,

34
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,313
which is true or false.

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,360
Now we can wire up the rest of the app.

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,830
In App Vue we're not using authentication,

37
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,410
but in the header we are.

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,540
Here I got login and logout buttons

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,590
and I'm using the is logged in instead

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,083
to show our height and extra menu item.

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,240
So to make that all work,

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,570
I'll add methods here

43
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,460
to wire up those buttons

44
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,550
and add a login method,

45
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,130
which will trigger this store,

46
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,510
this patch, and then log in.

47
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,880
We got no namespace here

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,793
because this is a route action directly in the store.

49
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,900
Now save the thing for log out

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,393
of course with a different action being dispatched.

51
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,420
And in computed I will add is logged in computed property,

52
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,950
which points at the this store

53
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,313
is authenticated getter we just added.

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,330
So that is this gather.

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,910
It's a global getter, not namespace,

56
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,003
which is why we access it like this.

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,470
This year should be at click of course not at logout.

58
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,970
This was a mistake on my side.

59
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,610
It was fixed in your attachment already though,

60
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,310
but make sure you have click listers on those buttons.

61
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,390
And then this works.

62
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,210
The admin page doesn't allow us to do much,

63
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,390
but we can go there.

64
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,900
Now we stay there if you log out,

65
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,150
but it's not about that at the moment.

66
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,050
Instead, this is about Vue.js

67
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,230
and you now hopefully have a good understanding

68
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,190
of how it works

69
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,663
and how you may add it to your projects.
