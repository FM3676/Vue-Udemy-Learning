1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,150
So that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,360
You learned what Vuex is,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,240
why you might want to use it, and how it works.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,750
It's all about having that central state,

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,620
which you manipulate through actions

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,993
and mutations and which you get through getters.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,250
You learned how to set all of it up,

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,760
and how to manage more complex states

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,950
with multiple modules and different folder structures.

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,810
You also learned about the map getters

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,150
and map actions helpers.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,530
Now Vuex in a nutshell isn't too complex.

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,230
Yes, you need to write some extra code to manage state,

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,610
but their after you have a clearly defined flow,

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,620
a clear structure for managing state.

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,120
And as you can absolutely see in this demo

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,040
and the demo before,

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,440
sharing state and manipulating it from anywhere

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,520
in your app in a clearly defined way is super easy

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,680
with Vuex in the end.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,830
And that's why Vuex can be very helpful in bigger projects

22
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,560
and why it can make managing state a breeze.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,350
It's much nicer then provide and eject

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,750
at least in my opinion, in bigger projects,

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,650
and can therefore definitely help you write any application

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,623
of any size you want.
