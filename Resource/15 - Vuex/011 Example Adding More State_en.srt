1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,180
Now let's say our application is growing

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,250
and besides this awesome counter feature,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,690
we now also got a user auth component,

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,920
which deals with user authentication.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,920
So in there we have a button where we say log in

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,820
and a button where we say log out

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,730
and it's depends on the off state,

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,380
which button we're going to show.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,990
Now, of course we could manage this locally into component,

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,140
but again, authentication might matter

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,080
to a lot of parts of zap.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,313
So we wanna manage it with UX and stat.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,590
here I just got this template with the two buttons

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,590
and app view, I'm now going to import user off

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,970
from components user off dot view

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,373
and register this as a new component user off.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,110
And therefore we can now use this

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,200
and I will create a new container here

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,180
to show it visually

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,833
that does this a different part of the app user off,

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,810
give this container a title prop off.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,500
and make sure I only show the first container.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,080
If we are authenticated.

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,850
Now at the moment we see those buttons,

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,230
but of course they don't do anything.

26
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,910
Well, that's something we can fix with UX.

27
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,100
And before I dive into the utility features

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,880
we have for managing bigger applications

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
with different kinds of state.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,290
Here's a quick pause,

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,720
which you can use to add the functionality in UX,

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,959
to react to a log in and a log out click

33
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,380
to manage some is locked in state

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,890
to show just one of the two buttons

35
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,950
and to show or hide this base container

36
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,720
based on the off state.

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,630
So add a new state and all the getters mutations and actions

38
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,230
you might need to manage this is locked in state,

39
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,730
which can be true or false in the end.

40
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,690
Here's a chance for you to pause the video thereafter

41
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,323
we'll implement it together.

42
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,300
Where are your successful?

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,783
Let's do it together now.

44
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,870
So I wanna manage an off state.

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,120
So in my state and my story here, I will have-

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
is locked in state.

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,730
Of course, the name is up to you,

48
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,700
which initially is false let's say

49
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,430
now in order to change it, I want one or two mutations,

50
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,063
depending on how you decide the mutation,

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,240
I will add one mutation and name it set off

52
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,390
where I expect to get the state, of course, and the payload

53
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,300
and the payload will be important here

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,420
because it will tell me wherever I wanna set the off state

55
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,203
to authenticated or to not authenticated.

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
So here I said, state is locked in,

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,320
equal to payload is all let's say,

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,430
and that can be true or false.

59
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,100
Now this is just my approach.

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,020
You probably have a different one

61
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,690
and that might be fine as well.

62
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,503
It's just one way of doing it.

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,630
Now that's my mutation,

64
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,600
but we shouldn't necessarily call mutations

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,340
directly from inside components as you learned.

66
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,650
So I will add actions.

67
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,850
Now we could add a set of action,

68
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,110
which basically works like the mutation,

69
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,110
or we add two actions to mix things up a log in action

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,390
and a log out action.

71
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,233
Again, it's just my way of implementing this.

72
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,320
We get this context object and in log in,

73
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,120
I want to commit, set off.

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,700
That's the name of my mutation, this one,

75
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,660
and the payload will be an object here

76
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,660
where I said is off to true because it's the log in action

77
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,740
I want to set the user to logged in.

78
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,840
So dis is off property,

79
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,023
which I'm reading here in the mutation is true now.

80
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,160
And in log out, it's almost the same.

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,173
It's the same mutation which I commit, but it's false.

82
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,270
Now of course, these actions could be asynchronous

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,810
In reality, we are probably sending

84
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,870
some HTTP requests around,

85
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,110
but here I will not care about that.

86
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,460
I will keep it simple and keep it synchronous.

87
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,730
But in actions, of course,

88
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,513
we could also use asynchronous code as you learned.

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,940
So now we've got actions, mutations,

90
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,040
and a state what's missing a getter.

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
So I will add a new getter name is up to you.

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,793
I will name it user is authenticated.

93
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,890
And here we get our state and I will return.

94
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,890
State is logged in, which is true or false.

95
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,160
Now I have everything in the store

96
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,760
which you'll want to have there.

97
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,500
With that back and user off.

98
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,680
I want to wire up these buttons.

99
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,740
So I'll add my script part and now add my methods

100
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,163
for the actions that should be dispatched.

101
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,240
We could use map actions here,

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,300
or we add the manually totally up to you

103
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,634
to show all approaches, I will add the manually here,

104
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:37,634
add a log in and a log out method here.

105
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,520
And in log in, I will call this store dispatch log in

106
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,150
because log in was the action name I defined

107
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,590
and for log out it's the same,

108
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,033
but of course, with the log out action.

109
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,030
And now we can set up the click listeners,

110
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,469
trigger our log in method on the first button

111
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:03,083
and trigger log out on the second button.

112
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,140
With that we should be manipulating the state

113
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,190
now to reflect it i also want to listen to changes.

114
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,130
For example, here,

115
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,310
I only wanted to show one of the two buttons

116
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,333
at the same time.

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,790
For dav we can use computers to get access to the getters

118
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,440
either with map getters or by setting up

119
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,547
our own computed properties.

120
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:28,591
And here I'll add the is off computed property

121
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:32,810
where I returned this store getters

122
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,910
and I named together user is authenticated.

123
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,470
So that's the getter

124
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,950
I wanna access here and now is off,

125
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,980
is a computed property, which is true or false.

126
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,710
And with VF, all showed a login button is off,

127
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,010
is false because of the user is not authenticated.

128
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,500
I want to show the log in button

129
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,550
and I want to show the log out button

130
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,683
if we are authenticated.

131
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,550
And we can copy the computer property

132
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,550
into the app view file now here like this,

133
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,100
because I also need is off here to show

134
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,010
or hide this first base container.

135
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,870
So here with VF, I wanna show it if is off,

136
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,113
is true and hide it if it's false.

137
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,580
With that initially, we don't see it

138
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,870
because initially we're not logged in,

139
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,740
but if it click log in, we see it.

140
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,310
We can change everything, but if I click log out,

141
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,900
we hide it.

142
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,410
So that works.

143
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,199
And that's an extra piece of state managed.

144
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,910
Now that wasn't nice practice,

145
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,600
but I started this lecture mentioning

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,580
that our app could be getting bigger

147
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,860
and that we had more and more States to manage.

148
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,420
So here in this demo,

149
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,930
we now added at least a little bit of extra info

150
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,610
to our store.

151
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,470
View UX also gives us utility methods

152
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,520
and features when it comes to managing bigger stores

153
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,363
with different kinds of state inside of it.
