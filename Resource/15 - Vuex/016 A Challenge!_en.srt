1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,370
So now that we've learned

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,850
the basics about Vuex, I want you to practice it

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,410
in at least a little bit of a bigger application.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,500
You'll find this application attached,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,730
as always, NPM install, and NPM run serve, are your friends.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,120
And we've got this very simple demo online shop there.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,490
Got a few products, we can add them to a cart,

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,120
and you see this cart counter increases

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,250
every time I add a product.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,280
We can then view our cart, see the cart's total here,

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,580
see our items here.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,500
And we can remove items from the cart,

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,900
and everything updates.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,600
We also got this login button,

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,700
which doesn't do anything at the moment, actually,

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,810
even though it should,

17
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,110
but here we're facing some limitations

18
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,210
by a provide and inject.

19
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,950
If you update something which is not an array,

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,840
or not an object, like in this case,

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,070
where I'm in the end updating, is logged in,

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,420
which is a bullion,

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,560
the changes to that will not be reflected

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,283
back to the components that inject that status.

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,300
We don't have to worry too much about this though,

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,450
because your goal is a different one anyways.

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,320
I want you to try to migrate this entire state,

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,520
which is managed application-wide, to Vuex.

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,680
So, the products

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,570
and the, is locked, in state, also the cart.

31
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,460
Set up Vuex in whichever way you want

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,460
using modules, or not using modules,

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,930
using namespaces, or not using them.

34
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,833
And try this on your own as a practice.

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,350
From the next lecture on,

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,530
we'll migrate this together

37
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,053
so that you see my possible solution.

38
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,480
This will be a great practice,

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,100
and hopefully helps you understand

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,513
how you really use Vuex in projects.
