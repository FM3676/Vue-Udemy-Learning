1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,150
As you build bigger and bigger

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,770
Vue applications,

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,620
managing your application state,

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,250
your application data

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,900
can become more and more challenging.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,020
This module is about a better state management solution

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,500
called Vuex.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,950
Which can be used to replace, provide and inject

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,740
for data which you wanna share across multiple components

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,660
possibly across your entire app.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,600
Now to understand Vuex in detail,

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,660
in this module,

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,600
we'll first of all dive into what exactly Vuex is

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,690
and why exactly we need or use it.

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,220
And then of course we'll explore it from the ground up

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,220
so that you understand how Vuex works

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,620
and how you can use it in your Vue applications

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,450
to manage your application data

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,393
in a better way.
