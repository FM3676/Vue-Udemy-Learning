1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,960
So actions are important

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,510
for asynchronous code, and in general,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,650
it is a good practice to use actions.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,020
Now, I did mention that we have this context, object

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,400
which we get as an argument automatically,

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,590
and that it's full of interesting things.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,670
Thus far we're only using the commit method though.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,743
So what's inside of context as well?

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,170
Well, we can simply console log context

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,160
to have a look into it.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,180
So now I log it in increase so if I run, Add 10,

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,550
here is the log.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,420
And we see we got this commit method, which we already saw,

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,470
but we see a couple of other interesting things.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,650
Let's ignore route getters and route state for now,

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,920
but let's have a look at dispatch.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,363
You can also dispatch a number action from inside an action.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,660
This can be helpful if you're sending an HTTP request,

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,120
and if it succeeds, you wanna trigger a success action,

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,390
if you get an error,

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,519
you wanna trigger an error handling action.

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,300
Then you could have one action

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,990
that dispatches multiple other actions

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,883
in reaction to different results of HTTP request.

25
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,760
You can also access getters

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,800
in case your action needs some calculated value,

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,563
which would arrive in some getter.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,790
And you can also directly tap into the state,

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,900
in case getting access to the getters might not be enough.

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,720
You should not manipulate

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,520
the state from inside the action though.

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,733
Always use a mutation for that.

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,160
So that's context and these are actions

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,793
and with state,

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,340
mutations,

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,180
actions and getters,

37
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,370
we get the core concepts vuex uses

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,980
to manage state application wide

39
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,010
which you can then use conveniently

40
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,263
from inside any component.
