1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,760
Now for this module.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,520
As many times before you find a starting project attached,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,280
which you can download, extract,

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
run npm install,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,430
and they're all after you can run npm run serve though,

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,310
before you run npm run serve,

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,590
let's already installed the vuex

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,973
and you can do it as with npm install dash dash save vuex.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,990
This now installs the vuex package into the project.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,280
Just like we installed the router earlier in this course.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,910
And now we can get started using vuex.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,500
And for that I got a very simple application here.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,180
Definitely not an application where we would need vuex,

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,890
but a great application to understand the core concepts

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,483
of vuex introduces.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,670
So let's start the development server with npm run serve,

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,670
and let's see what we got on the screen.

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,800
We got this simple container here.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,340
We're at just say Vuex,

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,000
now to get started with vuex,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,310
let's say here inside of this base container

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,810
in the app view template here,

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,550
I want to have a button

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,270
where I say Add one

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,110
and above the button.

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,280
I actually want to have a counter.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,400
Let's say <h3> tag where I output to current value

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,090
is starting at zero and then incremented by one,

29
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,740
every time the button is pressed.

30
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,970
Now we could of course implement this behavior

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,540
just with data and methods and what you learned.

32
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,320
And for a simple app like this,

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,900
we normally would do that,

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,509
but this module is about vuex

35
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,670
and understanding vuex.

36
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,700
So let's not do it with these tools.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,170
Instead, let's manage this counter state with vuex

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,150
as if it would be some global state,

39
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,610
which we need in other parts of the app as well.

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,540
And for that,

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,539
we started main.js And we start by creating a vuex store,

42
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,750
which stores our application state.

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,460
And there is one store per app.

44
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,490
So we create the store by importing, from vuex.

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,050
And what we import is to createStore function.

46
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,069
And you might see a pattern here,

47
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,938
createApp for domain vue app,

48
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,749
createRouter for the router,

49
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,453
createStore for the store.

50
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,387
Then we can store the store in a constant named store.

51
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:36,220
(chuckles)

52
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,000
And these are a lot of stores,

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,380
I guess, or storage's

54
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,737
and we can do so by calling createStore().

55
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,460
Now it createStore() takes an object

56
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,830
where we configured a store

57
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,470
and the most important thing

58
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,553
with which we start in our store is the state,

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,950
state() is a method

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,100
and it then should return your state object.

61
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,393
So it's a bit like data in a component.

62
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,730
Now this is the state of your application.

63
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,100
So this object will hold the application-wide data

64
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,390
and you only have one store for the entire application.

65
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,070
You might have multiple states though,

66
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,670
but I'll come back to that later

67
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,950
now to get started with our counter here,

68
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,230
we could have a counter here in our state object

69
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,023
and initialize it to a value of zero.

70
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,410
Now we need to connect our app to the store,

71
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,050
which we do by calling app.use and passing the store to it

72
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,283
just as we used the router in the routing module.

73
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,600
And now we can use that state in our component,

74
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,290
in any component of this entire app,

75
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,970
we don't need to add inject here or anything like that.

76
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,730
We can just use this state

77
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,820
and how do we do that?

78
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,030
Well, there now is a new property,

79
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,220
which we can access in every component.

80
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,210
And that's the dollar sign store property,

81
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,260
which points at the vuex store.

82
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,920
This then has a state property,

83
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,000
which points at the state managed by the store.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,640
And that state of course,

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,770
is this state object.

86
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,620
Therefore, we now have a counter property in there

87
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,313
to access our counter.

88
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,740
And if I do that and save this,

89
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,593
we see zero here.

90
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,470
Now clicking the button.

91
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,160
Of course doesn't do anything yet

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,180
because we haven't wired this up.

93
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,423
Let's do this next.
