1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,200
So we can attack,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,550
we can launch a special attack every three rounds

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,910
and we're already using some nice view features

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,870
that make building such a game very very easy.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,030
Now let's move on to the next button,

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,650
to the heal button.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,850
Maybe we as a player took too much damage

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,760
and we wanna heal ourselves.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,540
So we should implement a functionality for that as well.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,710
So in the methods of my view app,

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,870
I'm going to add a heal player method

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,830
because the heal functionality, the heal button

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,793
of course should heal the player not the monster.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,250
For that I'll calculate a heal value

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,300
and we can use the same get random value function

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,320
to get a random value between two boundaries,

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,510
and it's up to you which values you wanna use here.

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,220
Since the monster hits us between eight and 15,

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,620
I want to get a heal value of let's say eight and 20,

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,420
so between eight and 20.

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,080
And now of course we'll just reach out to the player health

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,053
and simply add that calculated heal value.

23
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,470
But we should be careful here.

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,870
Always adding this heal value like this

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,020
would introduce a bug in our game

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,020
because we could heal ourselves above 100 health.

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,780
We start with 100 health

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,570
and we shouldn't be able to heal ourselves

29
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,813
for more than that.

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,180
So to prevent that this happens,

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,350
we can add an if check here in heal player

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,590
and check if our player health

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,180
plus the calculated heal value would exceed 100.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,710
And if that's the case,

35
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,640
if we would heal ourselves above 100,

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,790
then I instead want to set the player health to 100

37
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,860
so that we can't go higher than that.

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,900
And only in the else case

39
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,440
if our current health plus the calculated heal value

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
does not exceed 100,

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,860
only then I wanna add the full heal value

42
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,440
to the player health

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,603
simply to ensure that we can't go above 100.

44
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,270
So, with that we got the heal player method,

45
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,790
now we can connect it to the button

46
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,390
by adding a click listener as we did many times before,

47
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,773
and by calling heal player just like that.

48
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,200
And if we now save that and reload,

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,220
if I press heal initially, nothing happens

50
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,730
but if I launch a special attack,

51
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,060
this works, I can attack

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,600
and now let's heal ourselves, that worked.

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,330
Heal ourselves, that worked.

54
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,800
So that's looking good.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,750
But we're not fully done.

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,050
For one, healing ourselves

57
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,420
should also count as a round in the game.

58
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,420
So of course here I also wanna increment the current round.

59
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,420
In addition the monster should attack us thereafter

60
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,930
because just because we heal ourselves

61
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,130
does not mean that the monster does nothing.

62
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,420
So once we're done healing ourselves,

63
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,290
the monster will attack the player,

64
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,163
and we do that by calling the attack player function.

65
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,140
And now with that, if I reload,

66
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,990
you see if I heal myself initially,

67
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,060
my health still goes down

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,630
because healing myself initially makes no sense,

69
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,140
I already have a health of 100, so we heal by nothing.

70
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,140
But the monster attacks us thereafter

71
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,503
and hence we take damage.

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,600
But of course we can still heal ourselves thereafter

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,433
and eventually well try to win that game.

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,490
Yeah, like that.

75
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,490
So, that should work,

76
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,300
but of course we're still not done with the game at least

77
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,280
because we now have all those actions here

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
and the health bars change appropriately,

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,030
but how does the game end?

80
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,690
We want to ensure that either the monster

81
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,770
or the player wins or for the unlikely scenario

82
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,950
that we both go below zero health, that we have a draw.

83
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,670
And that could happen by the way

84
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,899
since we attack and the monster always attacks back,

85
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,560
we could launch an attack that takes the monster below zero

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,800
and then with its last blow,

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,970
the monster also takes us below zero health.

88
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,210
So a draw would be possible.

89
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,630
Well, let's work on those win and lose conditions next,

90
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,960
of course feel free to try implementing this

91
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
on your own first

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,280
before we then implement it together

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,043
because that of course is a great practice.
