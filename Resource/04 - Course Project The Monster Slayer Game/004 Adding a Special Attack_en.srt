1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,110
Now that the attack button

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,610
and the attack action is working,

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,710
let's implement the next action

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,340
we wanna support in this game.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,630
And that is the special attack action

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,513
and therefore the special attack button that should work.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,830
The idea here is relatively simple.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,080
I want to do the same as an attack monster,

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,140
but we should deal more damage.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,670
On the other hand and to not make this too powerful,

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,560
the special attack should therefore

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,590
not be available all the time

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,630
but only every three rounds.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,480
So let's start by adding this method though.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,803
I'll name it specialAttackMonster.

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,170
And in here I want to calculate an attack value

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,840
but let's say between 10 and 25 damage points.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,363
So we have the potential to do quite a lot of damage.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,590
Of course, just as before,

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,160
we then reach out to the monsterHealth

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,823
and deduct the attack value from it.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,760
And also just as before,

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,570
the monster should still attack us back thereafter.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,730
It does not just attack back if we launched a normal attack,

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,410
it also attacks back if we use a special attack.

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,819
So here we call attackPlayer, thereafter,

27
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,088
to make sure that we as a player

28
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:27,921
are attacked after we launched a special attack.

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,510
Now, with that,

30
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,360
we can connect this special attack button here.

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,300
Again, by adding a click listener

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,600
and then by pointing at the specialAttackMonster method

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,763
we just added.

34
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,380
And if we saved that

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,430
and save the JavaScript file and reload.

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,040
If I click special attack, I'm doing a lot of damage

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,450
to the monster, as you can tell by its quickly shrinking

38
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,230
monster health bar.

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,160
But the problem is, that right now we can spam this attack.

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,520
So winning would not be too hard

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,980
because we can press the same button over and over again.

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,230
And therefore I wanna restrict this powerful attack.

43
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,990
It should only be available every three rounds.

44
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,330
And when it's not available,

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,793
this button therefore should be disabled.

46
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,140
So how could we implement that?

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,163
How could we make sure that this is the way it works?

48
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,280
Well, we could keep track

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,150
of the number of rounds the game is already lasting.

50
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,620
For that we can add a new data property

51
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,400
because we got a new piece of data

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,080
we wanna change and update and be aware of

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
and I'll name this, currentRound.

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,160
I'll add it here to the data property

55
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,240
and not add it as a regular JavaScript variable,

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,530
for example, because we'll need access to it

57
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,360
from inside the view instance

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,750
and view needs to be aware of when it changes.

59
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,040
And that is all the case

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,093
if something is a data property in the view app.

61
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,710
So now we got the current round,

62
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,590
we start at zero and I wanna increment that round,

63
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,560
of course, whenever we do anything.

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,440
So whenever we attack and so on.

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,623
Whenever that happens, the round should change.

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,290
So therefore, for example, when we attack the monster,

67
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,770
I'll set this current round, plus plus,

68
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,920
to increment it by one.

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,840
When the monster attacks us,

70
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,120
I'll not do it,

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,880
because that will still be the same round, right?

72
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,860
The monster attacks us whenever we did something,

73
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,110
so we don't need to change the round again

74
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,560
when that happens.

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,010
But we need to change it

76
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,140
when we launch a special attack, of course.

77
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,670
So now we got this current round,

78
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,163
how can we now use it to control the special attack button?

79
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,440
Well, we can go back to index.html

80
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,360
and disable the button if the current round

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,233
is not dividable by three.

82
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,890
That makes sure that we can only use it every three rounds.

83
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,900
To achieve this, we can set the disabled attribute

84
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,300
of a button, but of course not like that

85
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,110
but instead to a dynamic value

86
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,920
and we can do that on attributes as you learned

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,920
with v-bind or again, this short hand of just :disabled.

88
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,400
And I want to set this to true or false.

89
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,180
And true or false should be derived

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,310
based on the current round.

91
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,570
So here we can access current round,

92
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,557
so this current round data property we added.

93
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:44,430
And use the modulus operator,

94
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,290
which we have in JavaScript,

95
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,420
to divide it by three and find out

96
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,370
what the remainder of this division is.

97
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,510
And we know if the remainder is not zero,

98
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,900
then this was not dividable by three

99
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,940
and therefore we know we're certainly not

100
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,990
in the third or sixth or ninth round.

101
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,120
And we only want to enable the button in those rounds.

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,150
So we'll disable it if the division of three

103
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,683
does not leave a remainder of zero.

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,590
If we saved it and reload,

105
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,370
the special attack's available

106
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,770
but once I clicked it, you'll see it's become gray.

107
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,430
And now I need to do two more normal attacks

108
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,380
before it's enabled again.

109
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,810
So this is now working the way it should.

110
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,360
But as so often, I don't necessarily wanna have that logic

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,240
in my HTML code and therefore I'll cut it here,

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,230
go back to app.js and add a new computed property

113
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,307
which we could name mayUseSpecialAttack

114
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,720
and in here we simply return this calculation

115
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,520
now using the this keyword though,

116
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,120
since we're in the view instance.

117
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,750
And with that, we can use the mayUseSpecialAttack

118
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,040
computed property here, just like that,

119
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,640
to make sure that the button is disabled

120
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,020
when it should be disabled.

121
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,490
So that's working now

122
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,860
and with that we ensure

123
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,470
that we only have access to the special attack

124
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,173
every three rounds.

125
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,333
And that's the special attack functionality implemented.
