1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,540
Now that we spent so much time

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,450
on dummy projects and all those important basics,

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,310
it's time for our first, a little bit bigger project.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,050
We're going to build this Monster Slayer game

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,490
in this module.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,650
It's a little game where we got various options

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,040
for fighting against a monster.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,790
We got a battle log where we can see what happened,

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,050
for example, how much damage we dealt.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,300
And most importantly, in this game,

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,050
we'll practice all those core basics we learned about

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,390
throughout the last modules and lectures.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,280
We'll practice data binding, interpolation, V-bind,

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,890
event binding with V-on.

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,290
We'll practice how to output lists of data with V-for.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,530
We'll have conditional content with V-if,

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,040
like this Game Over screen, and so much more.

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,140
It's all in there, and therefore,

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,720
that's the game we're now going to explore in this module

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,060
to really strengthen all that core knowledge,

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,400
we gained over the last module

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,410
and to ensure that we're all on the same page

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,080
and well-prepared to venture deeper into Vue JS

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,393
after this module.
