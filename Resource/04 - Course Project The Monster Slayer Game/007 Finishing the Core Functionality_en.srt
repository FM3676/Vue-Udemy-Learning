1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:05,000
I wanna start with the empty health bars

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,410
and for that we have our computed properties

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,690
with the Barstyles, right?

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,820
Well, we could change those a little bit

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,520
and tweak them to make sure that we set

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,520
our bar widths to exactly Zero percent if the game is over,

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,760
that should be fairly easy to do here because we can check

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,780
if this monsterHealth in the monsterBarstyles,

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,010
if monsterHealth is smaller than zero.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,970
If that's the case I want to return an object

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,800
where the width is set to zero percent

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,090
so that we set it exactly to zero,

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,960
a negative value can't be displayed,

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
So we need to set it to exactly zero

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,690
and only otherwise I returned

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,010
the dynamically calculated health,

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,160
and we can do the same here.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,210
Check the playerHealth,

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,210
whoops step playerHealth, if it's smaller than zero,

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,860
then I wanna return width of zero percent

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,393
and otherwise return the actual value.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,460
With that If I reload and I quickly try to end the game,

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,750
you see now my health bar is empty now that I lost

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,243
and if I try to win here real quick,

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,110
You'll see now to Monster Health is zero.

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,950
So that seems to work.

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,560
Now for restarting the Game.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,700
We could add a button in our Game Over box

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,623
below the h3 text.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,810
A simple button like this,

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,677
where we say "Start New Game".

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,960
Now this button should do what the name implies.

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,673
It should start a new game, when clicked.

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,870
for that of course, we need a method,

35
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,760
because we need a new action which we can trigger

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,400
from inside our HTML code.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,430
Hence, I'll add a new method here.

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,200
The position of the method does not matter by the way,

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,750
you can add it the end, in between or at the beginning.

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,290
And I'll just add it here because Start Game

41
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,889
sounds like it should be at the beginning.

42
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,510
And in here, I now essentially

43
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,980
wanna reset all those parameters,

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,680
so playerHealth, monsterHealth, currentRound, and winner,

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,690
this should all be reset when we start a new game.

46
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,690
So therefore we can set the playerHealth back to 100,

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,660
set the monsterHealth back to 100,

48
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,750
set the winner back to null because we have no winner.

49
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,680
And of course all those set the currentRound back to zero

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,320
because we start a new game again.

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,610
And now it's starts game,

52
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,690
that should be triggered when this button here is clicked.

53
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,330
So we simply add a click listener as we did it many times

54
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:53,873
before and point at start game.

55
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,730
And if we now save that and reload, let's give it a try.

56
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,320
Let's try to end this game here and see who wins.

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,390
It's a draw, but we have start new game.

58
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,260
And if I click this,

59
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,470
you see the health bars update and a new game begins.

60
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,513
So this is working here.

61
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,963
Let's also see if we can lose.

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,810
Yes, and this all works.

63
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,500
So now we got this Start New Game functionality as well.

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,070
We got the game working therefore,

65
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,240
but the surrender button is missing,

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,710
when we want to well, surrender.

67
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,520
And the battle log is missing.

68
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,060
A log which I wanna have at the bottom of the page,

69
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,350
which simply shows every action that happened.

70
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,004
So every damage dealt, every health point healed,

71
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:45,896
that should show up here

72
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:47,364
and I'll implement the surrender button right away

73
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:52,364
in this lecture already because it will be super easy.

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,650
If we add a new surrender method,

75
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,360
which we of course need to be able to do anything,

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,980
when that button is pressed.

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,410
I want to set the winner equal to monster,

78
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,860
because if the player surrenders the monster won.

79
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,390
Alternatively, we could also set the playerHealth

80
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,340
to a negative value, but I don't want to do that here.

81
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,300
I don't want to kill the player with, well,

82
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,040
by setting the health to zero or something like that,

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,339
the player simply surrenders.

84
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,700
So we just set the winter to monster and we're good.

85
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,060
And now we can go back to index HTML

86
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,770
and on the surrender button.

87
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,310
We bind it with a click listener,

88
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,963
to the newly added surrender method, just like that.

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,593
If we now save that and reload, if I click surrender,

90
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,193
I can start a new game.

91
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,420
One thing, however is not ideal.

92
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,670
Even if I surrender,

93
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,640
I can still press attack and the health bar still update.

94
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,640
So we might want to disable all those game action buttons.

95
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,290
If the game is over or remove the controls entirely,

96
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,410
if the game is over and that's actually something I will do

97
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,870
here to finish this lecture,

98
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,340
we do show this Game Over container.

99
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,160
If we do have a winner with V-if.

100
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Now this section is a direct neighbor of this section.

101
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,220
So here we could make sure that this only shows up

102
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,680
if we don't have a winner with, not winner.

103
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,050
So if winner is falsely or since it is a direct neighbor

104
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,540
by using V-else so that we only have those game controls,

105
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,400
if we don't have a winner yet.

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,500
And if we do have a winner will not have the game controls.

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,220
So if I save that again and I surrender,

108
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
now the game controls are gone

109
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,720
and I have to start a new game

110
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,330
to bring them back and the same happens

111
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:50,522
If we lose the game naturally.

112
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:51,355
The game controls are gone

113
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:53,020
and we have to start a new game.

114
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,150
And with that I think the Core Game functionality

115
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,460
is finished now.

116
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,370
And next we can work on that battle log,

117
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,010
again as always feel free to implement something

118
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,170
on your own there,

119
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,563
we'll do it together in the next lecture.
