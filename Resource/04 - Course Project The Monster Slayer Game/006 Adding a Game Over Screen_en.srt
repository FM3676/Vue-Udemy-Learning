1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,090
So, how do we now check who won

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,393
and who lost?

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,000
Well for that, we need to basically check the health values,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,800
the player and the monster health.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,960
That is what matters to us here.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,960
And hence we could add if checks here after we attacked

7
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:24,149
the player, so after both the monster

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,642
and the player got attacked.

9
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,648
Here, we could check if this player health

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,981
is smaller than zero, in which case the player lost.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,656
And we could check if maybe all the Monster health

12
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:38,058
is below zero and so on.

13
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:41,200
But we would have to repeat this check.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,310
We would have to repeat this check

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,670
in the special attack monster function,

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,090
and also in the heal player function,

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,110
because maybe we healed ourselves,

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,750
but the monster still dealt too much damage

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,053
and we still died.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,820
So repeating the same code in all those places.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,790
That's not what I wanna do because repeating code

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,950
is never good.

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,390
If we ever decide to change something,

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,270
we need to change it in a lot of different places.

25
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,150
And therefore we wanna avoid that.

26
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,680
Instead with view, we have a nicer way of keeping track

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,130
of something than doing something in reaction to that.

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,163
We could add a watcher.

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,020
So I'm going to add watchers here by adding the watch option

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,480
to the configuration object.

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,980
And here, I wanna watch two properties, the player health

32
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,630
and the monster health.

33
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,900
So we add a watcher for the player health property.

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,410
And as you learned, this name is now not up to you,

35
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,180
instead that has to be the name of a property

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,050
you wanna watch and you wanna watch

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,723
this player health property.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,320
And hence I'll add a second watcher,

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,123
where I watch the monster health like this.

40
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,530
You all learned that we get the values then

41
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,220
of those watched values whenever to watch your triggers.

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,070
And therefore let's now start in the player health watcher.

43
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,600
There, we need a regular if check where we check

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,350
if the value, so the player health is smaller

45
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,410
or equal than zero.

46
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,150
And if let's say the monster health also is smaller

47
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,630
or equal than zero.

48
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,120
In that case, we would have a draw

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,170
because both participants are below zero.

50
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,000
Now, another case would be if just the value

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,380
is smaller or equal than zero.

52
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,530
So the first condition is not met, but the value.

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,930
So the player health is below zero or equal to zero.

54
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,690
Then we know the player lost.

55
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,670
We don't need to check the monster health being smaller

56
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,200
than zero here, because we're going to do this

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,670
in the monster health watcher.

58
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,400
There, indeed, I wanna check if the value.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,750
So now the monster health is smaller or equal than zero.

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,313
And if the player health is smaller or equal than zero.

61
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,943
In this case, as mentioned, we have a draw,

62
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,330
or else, if just the value of the monster

63
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,853
is smaller than zero, then the monster lost.

64
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,870
Now of course, I am aware that

65
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,040
if we take the monster below zero and then hits us

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,900
and takes us below zero, both watchers fire,

67
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,110
because both healths changed

68
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,650
and therefore the if checks run twice.

69
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,780
And we'll find out that we have a draw twice.

70
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,130
This won't be a problem however, because you will see

71
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,810
what we do with this information.

72
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,080
We're just going to show something on the screen

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,290
and it will only show up once there.

74
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,840
So finding out that we have a draw twice

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,313
will not be a problem.

76
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,590
What do we want to do if we have a draw then,

77
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,720
or when the player lost or the monster lost?

78
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,193
Well, we probably shut this place message on the screen.

79
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,230
And for that, let's go to the index HTML file.

80
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,890
And here above the controls,

81
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,519
but below the health bar sections,

82
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,603
I'll add a new section null.

83
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,263
Give that section, a class of container,

84
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,500
which will just give it some default styling.

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,500
And now inside of that section, I wanna say game over

86
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,320
and then either say you lost or you won, or it's a draw

87
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,340
and also present a button to start a new game.

88
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,460
And that screams for what?

89
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,770
For v if, because now we have conditional content.

90
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,720
First of all, this entire container

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,810
with the game over message should only be shown

92
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,740
if the game really is over.

93
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,860
So if we either have a winner or a draw.

94
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,210
And then the message below that, something like

95
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,220
you lost in a h3 tag, or you won, or it's a draw.

96
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,140
Those h3 tags should also be shown conditionally

97
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,973
depending on who won or who lost.

98
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,250
And therefore we need to not only check those values,

99
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,520
but also change something which we can then reflect

100
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,470
in the HTML code.

101
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,250
And that against screams for a data property.

102
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,410
Here, we could store the winner

103
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,990
and initially set this to null because initially

104
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,913
when the game starts, we have no winner, of course,

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,040
But then here, if we have a draw,

106
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,250
I want to set this winner equal to draw, let's say.

107
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,260
So to a string that says draw.

108
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,510
If the player lost,

109
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,500
I want to set this winner equal to monster.

110
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,900
Because the player lost, the monster won.

111
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Here, it's this winner, which is a draw again.

112
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,963
And if the monster lost this winner,

113
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,033
of course is equal to the player.

114
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,340
So now we have the winner data property,

115
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,010
which is either null or if it's not null,

116
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,380
holds a string of draw monster or a player.

117
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,950
And we can use that in conjunction with v if

118
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,940
to conditionally show this entire game over container,

119
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,100
but then also to different messages.

120
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,010
The entire container can be shown with v if

121
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,230
if indeed winner is truthy.

122
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,030
By default at the beginning, it's null,

123
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,680
and that is treated as a falsy see value in JavaScript.

124
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,270
So if I said v if winner and winner is null,

125
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,920
this section will not show up because null

126
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,823
is interpreted as false.

127
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,640
If it is a string like draw or a monster or player,

128
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,110
the concrete value does not matter, then this is truthy

129
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,403
and they for this section does show up.

130
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,840
Now inside of the section, we also need v if

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,380
here on the h3 elements.

132
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,380
I wanna show you lost if winner is equal to monster.

133
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Else if, and for that we can use v else if directive,

134
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,020
I wanna show the second h3 tag if winner is equal to player

135
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,150
because if the player won, I wanna show you won.

136
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,750
And last but not least with v else, we can show it's a draw.

137
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,610
We could also use v else if to check a winner

138
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,150
is equal to draw, but since we know that

139
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,670
we only have those three options,

140
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,973
I can always just use v else.

141
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,460
With that added, if we now reload,

142
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,580
you see initially we have nothing here.

143
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,000
By the way, when the game loads, you briefly see

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,890
that our content show up until the view framework

145
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,900
is downloaded.

146
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,610
That is something we'll always tackle later

147
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,443
in the course.

148
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:24,490
Later, we'll have a different setup

149
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,120
where this initial flickering is not visible

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,810
just as a side note.

151
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,100
But here that is our starting setup now.

152
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,659
And now let's try to end the game.

153
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,793
And let's see who's going to win.

154
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,799
Okay, looks like we lost.

155
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,100
The health bars are not reflecting this

156
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,500
because they basically don't go into that negative.

157
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,820
They don't reach zero,

158
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,240
but we see that you lost message.

159
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,460
Now let's reload and let's try to win.

160
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,700
So for that, we need to use the special attack

161
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,243
and also heal ourselves a little bit here.

162
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,810
Special attack, attack, heal ourselves maybe,

163
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,300
special attack, and we won.

164
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,453
And let's see if we can achieve a draw here.

165
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,150
I'm not sure, I won again, here it is.

166
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,730
I was able to achieve a draw as well.

167
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,690
So this seems to work,

168
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,810
we're showing the proper message here.

169
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,210
Now let's make sure we also do a restart the game thereafter

170
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,630
if we do have such a draw and let's maybe also update

171
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,070
the health bar correctly, to really have

172
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,823
an empty health bar if the game is over.
