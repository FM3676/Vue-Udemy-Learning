1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,230
So, obviously, we need a back end.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,663
Now creating a back end,

3
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:09,548
that is something you could take an entire course on

4
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:12,328
because for writing server side code,

5
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:15,420
for writing code that runs on a server

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,350
and for connecting a database to that code.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,880
There are dedicated programming languages

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,500
like Node.js or PHP.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,580
And you can for example,

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,673
take my Node.js course if you want to learn all about that.

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,827
This course focuses on view

12
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:33,330
and therefore I want to keep that focus

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,060
so we're not going to write our own server side code here.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,080
Instead we're going to use Firebase

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,390
which is a service that gives us a back end

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,960
where we don't have to write any code

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,042
to get started with storing data.

18
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:49,980
I will emphasize though that this is not

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,070
just a database which we're using.

20
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,971
It's a complete back end service.

21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,560
It is like if you had your own server

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,167
with your own logic on it.

23
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,770
Just in this case, already pre-written

24
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,403
and pre-configured for you.

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,788
The good thing about Firebase, which is a service

26
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:08,960
offered by Google, is that you can get started

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,560
for free with it.

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,827
You can start for free and what we're going to do here

29
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:16,180
is possible for free.

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,992
And that's why I'm using this service.

31
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:22,830
All you need for this service is a Google account.

32
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,440
So make sure you create one

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,540
and then log in here into that console,

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,313
into the Firebase console.

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,980
Once you are logged in and in this Firebase console,

36
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,340
you can add a new project

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,926
and give it any name of your choice.

38
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:40,690
I'll name it vue-http-demo

39
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,720
but this name is up to you.

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,760
Click continue.

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,010
You can disable this,

42
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,290
you don't need that here, the analytics.

43
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,530
And then create this project.

44
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,800
Now Firebase is a service that has way more to offer

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,310
than what we are going to use.

46
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,453
Nonetheless it has all we need here to have a dummy back end

47
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,480
and that's why we're going to be using it.

48
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,070
We're also going to use this Firebase service

49
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,530
in a way that is typical for communicating with a back end.

50
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,009
So that what you learn here will also apply

51
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,750
to any other back end you might be using.

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,848
That's another reason why I chose Firebase.

53
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:19,660
So now, we're in the Firebase console

54
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,141
and here we want to go to database

55
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,075
because we are going to use the database part

56
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:27,000
of the Firebase service.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,020
It's just one of the offerings they have

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,510
but here we need a database.

59
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,477
And we are not going to use the Cloud Firestore here

60
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:37,140
but instead this real time database.

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
It's bit easier to use and it has

62
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,910
a nice rest API which is a specific

63
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,643
interface we can use for sending our http request to it.

64
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:50,280
It's very easy to use and therefore a great choice here.

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,580
So let's create such a real time database

66
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,713
and make sure you start in test mode.

67
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,633
Click enable,

68
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,140
and here we go.

69
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,670
Now, you should see something like this on the screen

70
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,483
and for the moment that is all we need.

71
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:07,400
Now let's leave it at that

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,340
and let's go back to our view app.

73
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,600
And here, we are now going to see

74
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,329
how we can send http requests to this Firebase back end

75
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,763
and how we're not going to do it.
