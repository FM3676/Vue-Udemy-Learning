1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,240
Up to this point in the course,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,800
we always worked locally.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,370
Our applications always ran in the browser

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,830
of the user using them,

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,700
so in this case, us, since we're the only one

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,000
who tested them thus far,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,520
but in reality, of course,

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,120
you often need to persist some data on a backend,

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,600
on a service side, because at the moment,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,460
we also already saw that we have the problem

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,460
that if the page is reloaded,

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,650
all the data that was generated by our Vue app is lost.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,420
We are going to have a closer look at that in this module

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,330
because this module is about connecting our Vue app

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,430
to a backend.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,273
It's about sending HTTP requests with Vue.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,250
For that I'll first of all clarify

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,150
what exactly a backend is and why we need it.

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,910
I will, of course, also show you

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,440
how you can set up a dummy backend.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,370
And then we're going to dive into how to send HTTP requests

22
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,060
from inside our Vue app to that backend,

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,863
with that let's dive right in.
