1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,320
Sending and getting data works,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,600
and that was the main objective of this course.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,680
But there is more we can add.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,390
For example, when we reload this page,

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,440
we can of course always load all submitted experiences.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,470
And that's the great thing by the way.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,090
Now, when we reload the page the data isn't lost

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,623
because it is stored on this back-end server.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,060
But when we reload, we might also want to fetch

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,910
all submitted experiences automatically,

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,576
without having to press this button first.

12
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,450
And that's something that's very easy to implement

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,940
in Vue.js.

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,120
In the user experiences component,

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,680
we have our code for fetching our data,

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,930
we have the load experiences method.

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,390
Well, of course we can also trigger this method,

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,770
not just when this button is clicked,

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,450
but when this entire component is loaded for the first time.

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,250
And how could we do that?

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,600
Well, you might remember this Vue lifecycle,

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,070
which every instance and therefore also every component has,

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,553
we can utilize that.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,170
Every component follows that lifecycle

25
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,565
and therefore here in user experiences,

26
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:15,950
we can simply add, maybe here towards the bottom.

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,483
We can simply add the mounted hook, for example.

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,530
This will be triggered when the Vue app is mounted,

29
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,550
and that means when it's fully initialized

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,730
and ready to get started.

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,260
And here we could now trigger the load experiences method,

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,315
ensuring that when this component is becoming visible,

33
00:01:36,315 --> 00:01:40,483
that then it will go ahead and load all experiences.

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,373
And if I do that and reload,

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,130
you see the experiences show up automatically

36
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,190
after a short while, without me pressing this button.

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,580
Now, so that is a useful improvement here, I would say.

38
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,973
What else could we improve?
