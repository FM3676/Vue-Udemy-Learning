1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,330
At the moment we assume, that everything is going to work,

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,970
that we never getting any error here.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,640
But of course in reality, we could be getting an error.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,450
So therefore beside checking this loading state,

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,440
I also wanna check whether we get data,

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,780
and because we might not get an error and still

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,350
not get any data, for example if we got no data here on

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,023
Firebase, if I delete all of that,

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,750
then we can send a successful request.

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,390
But it will get an empty response, because there is no data

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,490
to be loaded so we wanna handle that.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,730
And thereafter I also wanna handle real errors,

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,687
where the server times out, we have server site error

14
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:45,400
or anything like that.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,563
But let's start with the no data case.

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,600
We are setting our data here, to the results

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,850
and in the end handling the no data case is easy.

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,250
Will simply not be able to loop through any data here,

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,060
and therefore results will stay an empty array.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,050
So in this case, we should check not just if

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,660
we loading or not.

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,310
But here,

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,809
with "else-if" maybe I wanna check if we not

24
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,060
loading...

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,825
but that we do have data,

26
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,003
were the length is greater than zero.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,240
If length is equal to zero its an

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,843
empty array and that simply means we have no data.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,913
And of course its not data but results.

30
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:31,320
So if results length is greater than zero we could also

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,490
add an extra check, and check if we have a true feed

32
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,823
results value before we try diving into the length.

33
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,850
Here we always have results, but in other apps

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,820
that might not even be set if you fail to load data.

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,103
Hence checking this as well could make sense.

36
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,383
Then here we could add another paragraph,

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,763
where we say: "No stored experiences found.

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,120
Start adding

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,253
some survey results,

40
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,560
first."

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,310
And I wanna show this paragraph

42
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:09,610
"if" or "v-else-if"

43
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,358
where not loading,

44
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:14,220
but we don't have results,

45
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,060
or and therefore that should go

46
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,680
between brackets so that these two statements are

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,310
evaluated together, or we do have results but the length is

48
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,353
equal to zero.

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,574
So for not loading, but we don't have results

50
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:31,720
or our results length is equal to zero,

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,070
then I wanna show this "No stored experiences found" text.

52
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,273
Otherwise, I will check this and show my actual results.

53
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,560
If we save that and reload, we see loading and then

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,030
our no data message.

55
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,253
If I start submitting data though,

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,970
and then load the submitted experiences we see that works.

57
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,660
So now we handling the no data case.

58
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,443
But what about real errors?
