1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,650
So this is it for this module.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,500
You'll learn how to send HTTP requests,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,143
both to send data as well as to get data.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,330
You'll learn how to work with their response data,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,860
how to extract it, and how to show it.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,320
You'll learn how to show a loading text

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,683
or a loading spinner.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,700
You'll learn how to handle errors

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,300
in case something goes wrong.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,460
And in general, you hopefully now have

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,270
an understanding why we might want such a backend,

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,350
at least for some applications which we're building,

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,940
and how you can communicate with the backend

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,053
behind the scenes from inside your Vue app.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,590
Using the fetch function,

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,720
which is built into browsers, is just one way of doing it.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,880
I also did mention the axios package before,

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,630
which is a third-party package

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,780
you could add to your project,

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,240
which also allows you to send such requests.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,170
It just works a bit differently.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,200
For example, there, catch will automatically also trigger

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,370
if you get back error responses,

24
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,210
so that extra handling we needed with the fetch function

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,380
would not be required with axios, but that's it.

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,970
We're going to see this in action in a course project

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,720
as well, but this hopefully gets you started

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,800
and now gives you everything you need

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,733
for you to start sending HTTP requests in your applications.
