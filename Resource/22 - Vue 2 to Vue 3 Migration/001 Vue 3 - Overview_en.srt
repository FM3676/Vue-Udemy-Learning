1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:11,090
In this module, I will dive into view free and explain what changed with View Free and which new features

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,070
we have now.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,300
I want to start with one important note view version.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:24,080
Free is the latest version of a view, but there is a but if you visit the official GitHub repository

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,250
of View version free, which at the moment is the view next repository, not view the view next repository,

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,290
you'll find the release notes there.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,630
You also find them linked below the video.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,180
And the interesting thing here is that they follow a phased release process.

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,910
Now, what that means is that view core, the core framework is finished.

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,710
It's stable, it's out there.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,250
But some other parts of the framework, for example, the router and Buick's integration in the def

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,700
tools.

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:03,050
So some other packages and things that belong to the framework and to the Vuko system are not final

14
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:03,420
yet.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,570
That's why The View team decided to go with this phased release process where for the moment, if you,

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:18,320
for example, visit Viejas dot org, you'll still end up in the view to docs there.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,170
So you still start with view to their.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:30,690
Also, if you install view via NPM, so if you run NPM install, you also see that at the moment you

19
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:38,370
get viewers in queue on that latest tag you need to run NPM install you at next to get dead.

20
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,380
Real latest version.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:48,030
And you need to visit the free dog Viejas Dog to get to the view free version of the official website

22
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,230
and documentation.

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,190
Nonetheless, viewership of free is final.

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,480
And the word and you should learn right now, do the work and you should dive into right now.

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,370
You just should be aware of this phased release process and that all parts like the Web page and and

26
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,470
install latest version will only be switched to view free at the end of the year.

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,640
That's the plan, at least as you can see here.

28
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,200
So that's something to be aware of nonetheless.

29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,140
Now is the time to learn you free.

30
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,110
And if you're just starting with you, I would recommend that you do that with viewers and free because

31
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,440
it is stable and it is the future of view.

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,590
And the parts which still get some work might not matter to you.

33
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,400
You can find the next steps on which to view team focuses here, and none of these parts should have

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,750
a strong impact on you if you're just getting started with the view at the moment.

35
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,360
So with that, let's now explore what changed with View Free and what's new now.

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,240
The good news is that not a lot of things changed.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,440
And what you learned for of you two generally still applies.

38
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,080
There aren't any major breaking changes that would force you to relearn everything.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,700
That is not the case.

40
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,190
But there are a couple of changes and a couple of new features you should be aware of.

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,790
I will highlight all important changes you should be aware of in this module, though.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,930
So let's start with the changes here.

43
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,800
I will just highlight the most important changes which will likely affect everyone, or at least a lot

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,690
of people for an exhaustive list of all changes, no matter how big or small they are and all new features,

45
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,560
definitely check out the official migration guide, which you also find attached to this video.

46
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,650
Now, the changes I'm going to list here will also all be shown in detail throughout this video.

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,230
One change that will affect everyone is that you now create your view instances, your view apps differently

48
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,600
than before the syntax changed and therefore you will need to change this in your apps as well.

49
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,150
But changing it as simple as you will see.

50
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,280
In addition, the data option now must always be a method.

51
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,220
It's no longer allowed to be just an object.

52
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,730
And another change that will affect everyone is related to how you register components, directives

53
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,110
and third party modules.

54
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,500
This will now also work a bit differently, as you will see.

55
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,620
But updating this and changing this will also be simple.

56
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,120
If you're using transitions in your app, the transition component, see us as class name changed the

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,040
dash enter class is now dash enter from and I'll show this in an example as well.

58
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,310
And that's almost it when it comes to just view.

59
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,290
As I mentioned, check the official migration guide for all minor changes as well.

60
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,930
But these are the most important changes you should definitely know now if you're using the view router

61
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,270
there, we now also create De Ruyter differently and transitions with the router.

62
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,010
So if you have animations for switching pages, that also works differently.

63
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:03,330
Now, for a viewer, it generally works as you learned it, but we now create our store differently.

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,340
So these are the changes, and I'll cover them with concrete examples from the video.

65
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,310
We also got a couple of new features, which I'll cover.

66
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,600
We got two minor, but nice to have changes, a teleport component and support for fragments.

67
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,160
And I'll explain both what it is and why and how we use it in this video.

68
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:31,030
Of course, the biggest new feature, which was added with View Free, is the new composition API,

69
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,120
which and this is important, is 100 percent optional.

70
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:43,510
You can use it to replace the options API so you can use it to build your components differently.

71
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Instead of using data, watch methods and computers, you can use something else, but it is optional.

72
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,020
It will not replace the options API.

73
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,020
You can use it, but you don't have to.

74
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,850
And all also dive into that in detail, of course.

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,180
And then kind of a new feature.

76
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,100
We got better typescript support.

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,980
You could always use typescript with view.

78
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,330
But since View Free was internally rewritten from scratch and uses TypeScript internally, it now has

79
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,200
better support.

80
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,460
Now using typescript is still optional and at the moment at least, I'm not using it for most view projects.

81
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,820
But if you want to use it, you got better support.

82
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,870
So that's the overview.

83
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,510
With that, let's dive into the concrete examples.
