1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,160
I prepared a little project.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,340
You find a link to the GitHub repository

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,380
with all those examples attached to the video.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,700
And here we can walk through all those important changes.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,840
And let's start with the basic-app.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,940
With basic-app-v2.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,890
Here, I'm creating a basic Vue app with Vue version 2.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,170
Creating my Vue instance,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,060
having some data,

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,280
having a method to change that data

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,510
and having a component with a template,

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,730
which basically has a button where I emit a custom event.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,340
That's what I'm doing here.

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,510
And if we view this application

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,403
by simply opening this HTML file in the browser,

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,610
this is what we see

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,880
and when we click the button, this works.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,180
Now, this is Vue 2 and this is probably what you know.

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,940
With Vue 3, a couple of things change here.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,670
To be precise, I'll now cover these first three changes,

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,860
which are outlined here

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,240
because all these changes affect what we see here.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,363
So let's go to basic-app-v3.

24
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,780
There, we first of all have to make sure

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,740
we import the latest version of Vue.

26
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,900
And for that, I currently have to add @next here

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,050
since at the time I'm recording this,

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,380
Vue 3 is in release candidate phase

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,900
and not really finally released yet.

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,950
In the future, of course,

31
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,580
this default CDN link

32
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,600
will automatically pull in Vue 3.

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,880
And I will update this repository as such

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,450
that all the CDN links are correct all the time.

35
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,470
So here I'm now importing Vue 3 by adding this.

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,260
And with that added here,

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,700
we'll see that if I now open this index.html file

38
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,330
in the browser, this fails.

39
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,330
Now we clearly don't see the message anymore

40
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,720
because this base syntax here changed a little bit

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,330
with Vue 3.

42
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,840
Here in app.js, in the v3 folder,

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,520
I got the Vue 2 syntax

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,620
but this will not work anymore.

45
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,700
Instead, to create a Vue app,

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,770
we now no longer instantiate

47
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,180
the Vue constructor function here.

48
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,389
Instead on Vue, we calculate createApp.

49
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,280
That's a new method

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,030
that was added with Vue 3.

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,730
Now, to this createApp method,

52
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,810
we now need to pass our app config object

53
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,080
and here we can pretty much copy the object we used

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,140
in Vue 2 as well.

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,070
But there are two other changes you should be aware of.

56
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,880
The el property doesn't work anymore.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,950
Instead, we now mount our app to the DOM

58
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,120
by calling mount on the created app object.

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,580
So on the result of createApp.

60
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,740
And to mount, we pass that CSS selector,

61
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,960
which we previously had in el.

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,630
And we can get rid of new Vue now.

63
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,950
That's the first change.

64
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,740
In addition, well, I mentioned

65
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,040
that the data option also changed

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,253
and now always needs to be a method.

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,670
Now, in Vue 2, both was allowed.

68
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,410
You could have just an object

69
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,750
and you could have a method,

70
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,980
though a method was recommended in Vue 2 as well,

71
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,330
especially if you worked with multiple components and so on,

72
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,723
then you needed a method.

73
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,490
Well, now, with Vue 3,

74
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,820
data always needs to be a method.

75
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,970
So we simply should turn data into a method,

76
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,830
which then returns our data object.

77
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,090
So that's the only change we need to make here.

78
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,420
Besides that, it works as before.

79
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,900
And for example, methods computed in watch,

80
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,060
those things all work as you learned.

81
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,743
Nothing needs to change there.

82
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,957
And with that, we already covered

83
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:38,500
the first two changes here.

84
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,950
Now, the third change,

85
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,110
which we should be aware of,

86
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,680
also affects this demo app I prepared.

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,300
Components, directive, their-party modules,

88
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,340
all those things are now registered on the app

89
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,688
instead of the global Vue object.

90
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:56,160
So calling Vue.component, that's not how this works anymore.

91
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,170
Instead createApp creates an app

92
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,450
and we can store this in a constant

93
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,393
and then on this app, we can call mount, for example.

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,500
Now, it's also on this app

95
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,840
that we have to call component, directive

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,750
and use to use third-party modules,

97
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,250
which we'll see in action later

98
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,260
with the router and Vuex.

99
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,019
So here, we can call component

100
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,810
and then pass this component code,

101
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,790
which we also passed to the component method before,

102
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,660
so these two arguments,

103
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,470
to this component method here.

104
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,610
So it works as before

105
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,934
but now it's on the app instead of the global Vue object.

106
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:38,173
So with that, we get rid of this line here as well.

107
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,104
With that, however, if I save all of that,

108
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:46,100
and I reload, we got our message back,

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,660
we got the button and it works.

110
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,500
Now, one minor change,

111
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,520
which I didn't highlight on the slide,

112
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,890
if you have a component

113
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,140
that emits a custom method,

114
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,810
like here, this component.

115
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,230
It emits update,

116
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,740
there also is a new option you can pass

117
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,670
to this Vue instance config object here

118
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,020
and that's the emits options.

119
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,480
It's basically the counterpart to props you could say.

120
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,690
With props, you could specify all the props

121
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,030
a component receives,

122
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,950
and that was already the case with Vue 2.

123
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,880
With emits, you now can

124
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,430
and should also specify the custom events a component emits.

125
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,170
It's technically not required

126
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,870
but it makes your component easier to understand.

127
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,630
Now I can immediately see which custom event

128
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,380
will be emitted somewhere in this component.

129
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,443
It's a minor change but also something to be aware of.

130
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:39,780
And with that,

131
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,700
we covered these first three changes you should know.

132
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,840
Now, the fourth change is related to transitions.

133
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,233
There a CSS class name changed.

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,610
I also prepared an example for that.

135
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,150
The transitions folders here.

136
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,030
Let's start with transitions-v2.

137
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,050
If we open that in the browser,

138
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,860
we get this button and with that,

139
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,430
we can toggle the box here,

140
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,800
which has a transition attached to it.

141
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,760
This transition works simply because I'm wrapping the box

142
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,720
with the built-in transition component

143
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,350
and then adding my transition CSS classes down there

144
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,260
in the CSS file.

145
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,470
And this all worked with Vue 2.

146
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,870
Of course, because that's a Vue 2 example here.

147
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,025
Now, with Vue 3, this changes.

148
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:29,130
If I make sure that I import Vue 3 here

149
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,210
in the v3 folder, this example,

150
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,190
if I load the v3 example breaks.

151
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,490
Now, it breaks because we need

152
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,190
to create the app differently.

153
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,743
So let's quickly do that.

154
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,443
Vue.createApp.

155
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,310
Instead of el, call mount here.

156
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,260
And then also make sure data is a method.

157
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,410
That's what we just learned.

158
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,913
I just wanted to practice it here again.

159
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,100
But that's a simple change of course.

160
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,230
With that, we create the app properly.

161
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,260
And hence if we reload, now this works.

162
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,000
But you'll notice that the remove animation works

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,600
but the enter animation does not work.

164
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,561
Because a CSS class name changed,

165
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:16,561
the -enter class is now -enter-from.

166
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,600
Basically, to be in line with the other class names

167
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,350
because we had -enter-active

168
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,760
and -enter-to already.

169
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,180
Now we also have -enter-from

170
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,880
for the starting class instead of just -enter.

171
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,610
And it's the same for leaving.

172
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,290
This here should be -leave-from

173
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,950
instead of just -leave.

174
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,110
So a simple renaming of the class names is enough here

175
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,620
and once we do that, save everything.

176
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,163
Now we've got the animations back in Vue 3 as well.

177
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,010
So that were transitions.

178
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,910
We also got changes when we're using the Vue Router.

179
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,320
So let's see what changed there.

180
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,440
For that, I also prepared two projects.

181
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,480
Here's the Vue 2 version, here's the Vue 3 version.

182
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,630
And here I used the Vue CLI to create projects,

183
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,180
so it's no longer just an index.html file.

184
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,540
Therefore, I'll navigate in router-v2.

185
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,370
Run npm install

186
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,200
and then npm run serve

187
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,500
and this will install all the dependencies

188
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,680
and then also bring up the development server

189
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,913
for the Vue 2 version of this app here.

190
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,430
Once you load the app,

191
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,120
this is what you should see on the screen.

192
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,080
You've got two routes

193
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,550
and you can switch between them

194
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,123
and we've got a nice animation.

195
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,909
Now, how was this built?

196
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,919
I simply have my router set up in main.js

197
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,429
by using VueRouter,

198
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,150
which is imported from vue-router

199
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,670
and by adding the router here to the global Vue instance.

200
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,070
Registering all the routes,

201
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,580
setting mode to history

202
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,070
and we have the animation because the router-view

203
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,540
is wrapped with this transition.

204
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,330
This is how it works in Vue 2.

205
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,587
That's what you also learned in my course.

206
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:03,450
If we go to the v3 version

207
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,490
and also install everything there

208
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,610
and start the development server,

209
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,760
we'll see a difference.

210
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,280
To be precise, initially,

211
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,320
we'll not see anything

212
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,453
because I haven't added routing there yet.

213
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,150
In the router-v3 folder, in main.js,

214
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,120
we still have to add the router for good reason

215
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,340
because we now added differently than before.

216
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,420
Instead of importing VueRouter from vue-router,

217
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,910
I already installed the vue-router package here.

218
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,320
That's why it's available.

219
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,240
But instead of importing it like this,

220
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,060
you import createRouter from vue-router.

221
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,850
So you might see a theme here.

222
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,463
We have createApp from vue to create our app.

223
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,014
We have createRouter from the router

224
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:45,295
to create a router.

225
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:49,150
This is the new way of creating things in Vue 3.

226
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,508
Now, once this is imported,

227
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:55,508
we can create our router by calling createRouter.

228
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,470
And we then use this router on our Vue app.

229
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,910
So we can store the app in a constant

230
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,260
and then call use on the app

231
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,320
instead of on the global object.

232
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,770
I mentioned before that we no longer do that.

233
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,920
Instead we call app.use and use the router.

234
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,130
This is how we add the router.

235
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,360
But now we also need to configure the router.

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,350
For that, we still pass a config object to createRouter

237
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,700
and now we can generally grab the configuration

238
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,100
from Vue 2.

239
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,530
So here, I will grab the object,

240
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,433
which was previously passed to VueRouter

241
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,279
and paste this here into my createRouter function call.

242
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,270
The routes configuration works

243
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,470
just as you learned it.

244
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,010
That's the good news.

245
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,250
The mode, however, is set up differently.

246
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,500
Instead of setting mode to History,

247
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,620
you now need to set a history property

248
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,070
in this config object

249
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,930
and then create a history with another function.

250
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,560
And here you typically import createWebHistory

251
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,500
and then simply execute this here.

252
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,355
And the result of that is provided as a value to history.

253
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:08,700
This is how you set up a default router

254
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,870
using the HTML5 history mode for routing.

255
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,780
With that, we just have to add the imports

256
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,240
to WelcomeScreen and UsersList.

257
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,370
Copy that from the v2 example

258
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,620
into main.js in the v3 example like this

259
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,910
and now if you reload, our routes work again.

260
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,460
But you will notice that the transition is missing.

261
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,200
We've got no animation.

262
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,410
I also have another small addition or note,

263
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,908
which I wanna bring up first.

264
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:41,360
In TheHeader component, in the v3 project,

265
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,070
there is the exact prop on router-link.

266
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,680
This prop was needed with Vue 2

267
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,480
and the router for Vue 2

268
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,490
to make sure that the home link wasn't marked as active

269
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,050
when we were on Users

270
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,360
because Users also starts with a slash.

271
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,120
With Vue 3 and the router for Vue 3,

272
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,530
the router works differently internally

273
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,060
and you no longer need this.

274
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,380
It will automatically detect that home isn't active

275
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,844
if you are on Users.

276
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:12,820
That's just a minor thing but also worth noting.

277
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,250
More important than that,

278
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,262
as I just mentioned, the transitions don't work anymore.

279
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:21,130
The reason for that is that with Vue 3

280
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,968
and the router for Vue 3,

281
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:27,440
you no longer may wrap router-view with transition.

282
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,790
Instead, it needs to be the other way around.

283
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,240
Now you need to pass transition into the router-view,

284
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,057
so the router-view should wrap transition.

285
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,830
This is related to changes made internally

286
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,240
in the view-router package.

287
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,660
So router-view in the end has a slot internally

288
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,400
and needs this transition.

289
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,930
The problem just is transition, of course,

290
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,450
should wrap the component that is swapped.

291
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,490
And for that, you can use another feature built into Vue.

292
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,930
It's the dynamic component feature.

293
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,230
You can use the built-in component component.

294
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,150
This tells Vue which component to render.

295
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,710
Now, the router determines which component

296
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,750
should be rendered.

297
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,400
And you can get access here in this slot in the end

298
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,170
by using a feature called scoped slots.

299
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,660
This feature already existed in Vue 2.

300
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,690
And in my latest course update,

301
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,950
the Vue 3 course update,

302
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,480
which I added to my existing Vue course,

303
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,879
I cover it in detail as well.

304
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,810
You simply have a directive, the v-slot directive,

305
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,850
which you add to router-view.

306
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,410
And there you can then get access to special props,

307
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,260
which the router-view exposes to you.

308
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,950
You can now use these props here

309
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,600
between the router-view tags

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,840
and bind the is prop on component,

311
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,520
which component needs,

312
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,510
to slotProps.Component with a capital C.

313
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,100
This prop here is exposed to you by the router

314
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,980
and it holds the component that should be loaded

315
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,150
for the selected route.

316
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,430
This syntax certainly looks strange

317
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,180
but you only need it if you plan on using transitions

318
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,330
with the router,

319
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,390
otherwise you don't need it.

320
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,883
With that, however, if I save this,

321
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,240
now the transitions are back.

322
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,040
Well, at least almost.

323
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,740
We also need to adjust the transition names.

324
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,660
As you learned a second ago,

325
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,140
it's now enter-from and leave-from.

326
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,960
And once we do that, now the transitions are fully fixed

327
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,490
and now we've got nice animations for entering and leaving.

328
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,097
You might notice that if you load the app,

329
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,020
you've also got an initial transition here

330
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,300
and that's also related

331
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,860
to how the Vue router works internally.

332
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,303
If you wanna avoid this,

333
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:46,280
you need to mount your app only once the router

334
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
is fully initialized

335
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,840
and you can do this by going to main.js

336
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,220
and calling router.isReady,

337
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,370
which gives you a promise,

338
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,870
which resolves once the router is ready.

339
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,350
So if you mount your app in the function you pass

340
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,690
to this then block,

341
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,150
then you make sure that the app is only mounted

342
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,313
once the router is fully initialized.

343
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,480
And this will ensure

344
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,020
that you don't get this initial transition.

345
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,640
So with this change made to main.js,

346
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,230
now we can load without the initial transition

347
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,200
and we still got the transition for route changes.

348
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,210
So as you can tell, we have a couple of changes

349
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,930
to the Vue router, not to its core logic

350
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,970
but how you set it up

351
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,650
and how you add transitions

352
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,430
and now I guess you are aware of these changes.

353
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,280
Great.

354
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,550
Now, the last change I wanna cover here

355
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,540
is a change to Vuex.

356
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,178
The store is now created with createStore there.

357
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:40,550
I also got an example for that.

358
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,050
You find it in the Vuex folders

359
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,680
and if we have a look at the Vue 2 version here

360
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,470
with npm install and npm run serve,

361
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,470
you will see that it works just as you learned it.

362
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,750
We create our Vuex store

363
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,770
by instantiating new Vuex.Store

364
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,850
and passing our store config to it

365
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,573
and then we add the store to the Vue app, like this.

366
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,930
With that, this is what we get

367
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,673
and here we've got a basic store,

368
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:11,323
which is managing this list of users here.

369
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,180
Now, with Vue 3, this works differently.

370
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,703
If I dive into the v3 version of this,

371
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,570
and start this all,

372
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,510
we first of all, have to add Vuex again,

373
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,620
just as we had to add the router before

374
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,520
because now we added differently as you might guess.

375
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Now we import createStore from vuex,

376
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,270
again to be in line with how we create things in Vue 3.

377
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,846
Then we create our store by calling createStore

378
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,440
and now the good news is to createStore,

379
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,250
we pass exactly the same store config object

380
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,750
as we did with Vue 2

381
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,820
and Vuex for Vue 2.

382
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,049
So we can grab this object here,

383
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:00,760
which holds the state and mutations and actions and getters

384
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,713
and we use that same object here for Vue 3.

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,270
And that's important.

386
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,140
How you work with Vuex

387
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,930
and which features it has,

388
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,180
that has all not changed.

389
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,920
You still have actions, getters, mutations, state.

390
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,700
You can use modules.

391
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
That's the same.

392
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,997
But now we create the store like this.

393
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:24,380
And we then add it to our app

394
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,410
by you might also be guessing it already,

395
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,300
by using it.

396
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,070
So on our app, we simply use the store.

397
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,960
And if we also had a router here,

398
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
we would simply use the router as well.

399
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,280
We don't have it here but this is how you would use it.

400
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,680
And with that, if you reload the Vue 3 version,

401
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,823
this also works without any other changes.
