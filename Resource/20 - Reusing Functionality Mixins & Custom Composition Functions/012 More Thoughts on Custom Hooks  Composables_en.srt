1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,620
No, there are a couple of notes,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,810
which I still wanna make about our solution here.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,820
For one here enhance projects.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,030
I'm also using props user projects.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,650
Well, since we're already extracting user

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,973
into our ref here in this line.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,533
We can, of course also utilize this here.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,430
User dot value projects and access stat.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,790
One other thing I wanna highlight is this watcher .

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,370
here, I'm changing the value of the entered search term.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,540
Now keep in mind,

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,030
entered search term is exposed by our use search hook.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,130
It's one of the values I'm extracting here.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,450
It's originally defined inside of that hook.

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,860
Now changing things, changing a ref.

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,160
That's defined in that hook from inside,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,560
the component where you use the hook,

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,420
is something you can do.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,320
It will work as you can tell,

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,930
but maybe it's also something you wanna highlight.

21
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,420
for one simple reason,

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,120
to keep your code understandable and maintainable.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,780
If I see this code.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,810
I might think that entered search term,

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,810
should be a ref of this component,

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,370
and I'll not find it there.

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,340
Until eventually I see it's coming from this hook here.

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,640
In addition, changing it here.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,580
outside of the hook

30
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,130
could interfere with our logic you have inside of the hook.

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,230
It doesn't here,

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,883
but it could in other apps and other scenarios.

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,600
So therefore a more elegant way of changing a value

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,280
that's defined and used inside of a hook,

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,810
could be to define a separate function

36
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,570
that is meant to be used,

37
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,113
If you wanna change a value.

38
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,530
And we get such a functional ready update search,

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,900
it takes a value.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,330
And assigns this value'

41
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,540
as a new value to the entered search term.

42
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,420
And in the end, that's just what I'm doing here, right?

43
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,890
So therefore I can just call, update.

44
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,650
search and pass an empty string as a new value here,

45
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,980
because that's what I wanna do.

46
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,043
I want to set entered search term to an empty string.

47
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:08,889
There was this, I ensured.

48
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,100
That if I select a user and I'm filtering,

49
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,943
I still reset this when I select a different user.

50
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,210
So this watcher now still works.

51
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,180
and still resets my entered search ref.

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,800
But now it does this in a better way.

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,633
I would say.

54
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,123
Now with that,

55
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm done with the search functionality though,

56
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,360
as a final practice task for you.

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,690
I want you

58
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,100
to now think about a way

59
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,333
of outsourcing this sorting functionality.

60
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,540
We're only using it in one component.

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,920
but theoretically, that could,

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,230
of course also be used in multiple components.

63
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,740
So try creating a custom hook for this.

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,323
We'll do it together in the next lecture.
