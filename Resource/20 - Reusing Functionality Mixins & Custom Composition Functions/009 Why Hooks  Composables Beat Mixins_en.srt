1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,610
So now that we saw hooks in action,

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,983
why could they be better or nicer than mixins?

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,280
Well, I see two main advantages.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,390
For one, it's easy to make them configurable.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,120
As you saw in the last lecture,

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,550
adding extra parameters is easy

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,830
and all of a sudden, your hook is very versatile

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,460
and can be used in different components

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,433
with different configurations, which is great.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,810
In addition, they fixed one major flaw mixins have.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,380
With mixins, I mentioned that in bigger apps with more

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,980
and more mixins, it's hard to see which data property

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,950
and which method is added by which mixin.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,150
With custom hooks, that's easy.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,490
I mean, the custom hook returns

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,130
the things it wants to expose to a component

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,010
and therefore, we have to accept these things

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,400
like here, where we get an array

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,080
and pull the things we need out of the array

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,410
and store them in constants.

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,400
It's super easy to see that alertIsVisible, showAlert,

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,493
and hideAlert are coming from the useAlert hook.

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,860
So even if we would be using 10 or 20 custom hooks,

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,950
it would always be easy to immediately see which feature

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,020
and which data piece is coming from which hook.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,540
And that can be a major advantage

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,933
in bigger apps and bigger components.
