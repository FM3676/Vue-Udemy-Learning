1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,330
In this module,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,450
let's dive into another advanced concept,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,360
and that would be mixins

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,350
and custom composition functions,

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,520
or to be precise, the general topic

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,610
and idea of reusing code, both with the options

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,240
as well as the composition API,

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,660
because the bigger your projects get,

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,540
the more components you have in your projects,

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,610
the more often you'll face scenarios

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,600
where there is some code duplication across components

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,090
and you would wish for a solution to reuse code,

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,640
to share code across components.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,150
That will be the focus of this module.

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,970
To be precise, we'll dive into a general overview

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,380
of reusing things in Vue apps

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,160
and which different concepts we have when it comes to that.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,530
And we'll then explore two main strategies

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,440
for reusing code across components,

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,590
and that will be mixins for the options API

21
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,020
and custom functions or custom composition functions

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,820
when using the composition API.

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,463
So let's dive in and let's explore our options here.
