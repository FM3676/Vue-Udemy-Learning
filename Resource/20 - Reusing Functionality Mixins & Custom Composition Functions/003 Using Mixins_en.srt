1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,360
In this example, project, the logic,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,070
which I would want to reuse can be found in the add and

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,000
delete user components.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,650
There I basically have

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,780
the same data and methods and actually all

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,130
the components option, if you take a closer look.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,370
Now you might be able to reuse these logic by creating some

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,760
wrapper component,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,070
but another powerful tool for easily sharing this

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,950
configuration across both components are

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,523
the already mentioned mixins.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,190
For that I'll create a new folder mixins,

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,190
the name is up to you,

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,750
but I guess this name makes sense since I'm going

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,470
to store one or more mixins in there,

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,090
and I will add the alert mixin file,

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,490
or just the alert js file.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,563
The name is up to you though, how you wanna name this file.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,010
And in this new js file,

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,440
so not a dot vue file,

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,440
but in this js file, I want to store my shared config logic.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,480
And in this case here, it's actually an extreme case,

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,357
the entire config objects

24
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:09,190
for both components are exactly equal

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,190
they're exactly the same.

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,700
So therefore I will actually grab

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,350
this entire default export here,

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,100
copy it from one of the components and go to

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,583
the alert js file and paste it in there.

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,450
So now in alert js, I'm exporting this object

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,370
as a default object.

32
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,680
Now what's the advantage of this?

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,220
Well, now we can use this as a mixin, in those components.

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,800
So for example, an add user there, I can now import

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,730
the alert mixin this name is up to you

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,950
from, going up one level diving into

37
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,033
the mixins folder alert js,

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,900
and now we can remove all the code here so that we're left

39
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,930
with the empty config object and add a new option,

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,530
which we haven't used before, the mixins option.

41
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,210
And this takes an array where you add all the mixins,

42
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,940
so all the shared code you wanna apply to this component.

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,313
And here I add my alert mixin,

44
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,410
and I'm going to copy this now, go to delete user

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,940
and add the same code

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,913
there replacing the existing config object.

47
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,680
Now with that, there's just one more tweak we gotta do.

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,990
I get an error now regarding my user alert.

49
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,300
This import here is not required in delete user

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,100
and add user Vue anymore,

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,390
but we have to add it

52
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,903
in our mixin because here I'm referencing user alert.

53
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,930
So here I'm going to import user alert from going up one

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,443
level, going into components, user alert dot Vue.

55
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,150
With that, I can save this and reload.

56
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,713
And we get a warning failed to resolve component.

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,140
This mixin concept here will work,

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,900
but actually not for components.

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,090
If you've got components

60
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,100
that should be registered in a component,

61
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,630
this components option cannot be shared through a mixin.

62
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,560
So therefore we actually have to remove this and remove the

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,080
import we just added

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,350
and bring it back into our custom components

65
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,780
into our custom component options here.

66
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,680
So re-add components pointing

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,840
at user alert and re-add the import.

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,820
Yes, I know we just removed it,

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,030
but it is important to understand what you can and what you

70
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,940
cannot share through mixins and component configuration

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,573
can actually not be shared.

72
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,420
So let's quickly re-add it to both our add and delete user

73
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,053
components and save everything thereafter.

74
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,300
And with that though, if we reload,

75
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,570
this will just work and it works as before,

76
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,310
but there is one key difference.

77
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,140
Now we got way leaner add and delete user components where

78
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,770
the config objects simply contained the components option

79
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,910
and then the mixins option and all the logic we had in both

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,070
components before is now in our mixin,

81
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,760
and with these mixins,

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,730
you can share all the component options you typically have

83
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,230
with the exception of components as you saw here,

84
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,080
but you can share data, computed, methods, watchers,

85
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,080
whatever you need there, it can be shared through mixins.

86
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,180
And therefore mixins can be a powerful tool for

87
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,900
making your components leaner and sharing,

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,483
reused logic across components.
