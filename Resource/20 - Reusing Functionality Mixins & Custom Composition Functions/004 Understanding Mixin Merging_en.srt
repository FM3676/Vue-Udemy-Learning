1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,870
Mixins can be powerful

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,890
when working with the options API,

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,910
as you saw in the last lecture,

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,590
it's always important though,

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,730
to be aware of how mixins are merged

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,450
with the options you define in your components,

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,860
where you use them. Thus far, I only have one mixin,

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,270
in each component and I got no other options

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,513
besides the components option in those components.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,100
Now you could add more mixins,

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,050
but you could also have more component options.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,510
And let's say I also had a data option here

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,410
in the delete user component.

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,410
And in there I return a data object with some other data,

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,700
maybe with the alert title, let's say.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,510
Delete user. That could be my title.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,470
And now I wanna bind alert title to title prop

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,193
on my user alert component.

19
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,560
Of course we can do this with a colon

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,980
and then point at alert title,

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,633
which now is a data property of this component.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,020
There's just one important question.

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,020
Will this work after all the mixin also provides some data?

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,450
So which data wins the one of the mixin,

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,820
or the one of the lead user. And if one of the two wins,

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,040
does that mean that the other functionality breaks?

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,100
Well, let's see. If I reload and I click delete user,

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,970
the alert opens, and we see that title,

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,220
which I just defined as a data property

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,280
of the delete user component.

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,450
So actually no data option wins

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,123
instead vue merges the data.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,060
And that's important.

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,860
This is a built in mechanism when you have a mixin,

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,770
the options exposed by the mixin are merged

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,453
with the options you have in your component.

37
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,090
So for example, here in the alert mixin,

38
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,240
I have this alert is visible data property.

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,530
And by default, it's false.

40
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,820
Now this is merged with my component

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,970
and the data for,

42
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,780
in the end my component has this property as well

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,603
because I'm applying this mixin.

44
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,570
But I could also add the same data property here,

45
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,280
cue the data of delete user, and set it to true,

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,930
which is a different value than applied in the mixin.

47
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,713
And if I do that and save it,

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,050
we see when I reload my app,

49
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,270
this alert is opened by default.

50
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,250
So this means that my component option,

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,150
where I set this to true,

52
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,530
hence making sure that the alert is opened by default,

53
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,420
this component option overrides the option set by the mixin.

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,570
And that's indeed how vue merges mixins

55
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,489
with component options.

56
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,310
The component options win if there is a clash.

57
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,820
By default, data is simply combined, but if you have

58
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,730
like, we have it here, for example,

59
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,580
the same data property in your component,

60
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,790
as you have it in a mixin, the component option wins,

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,923
not the mixin.

62
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,250
This is how you merge the data

63
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,993
between component and mixin.
