1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,950
We now know that components

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,130
can be very useful.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,600
We know how to build them, how to make them reusable.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,030
Also, with the help of props and custom events,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,530
we learned how to combine components

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,140
and start building user interfaces with them.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,730
In this module, we're going to dig a bit deeper.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,010
We're going to dive deeper into components

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,360
to unlock their full potential and to turn you

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,220
into a component and today,

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,470
for most importantly, view master.

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,930
Now, specifically, we're going to have a look at

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,090
component registration and styling.

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,750
Of course, we already know how to register a component

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,850
with our Vue app, but it turns out

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,640
that there is more than one way of doing that,

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,740
and that every way has its purpose

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,040
and could be the right way of doing it

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,180
under certain circumstances.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,380
We're also going to have a look

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,170
at how we can style components

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,367
and make sure that certain styling

23
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,840
only affects certain components.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,670
We're then also going to explore a concept called slots,

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,920
what that is, and why it is useful,

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,877
and we're going to explore dynamic components

27
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:16,020
and where dynamic components could help us.

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,570
And last but not least,

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,820
we're going to have a look at component names

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,950
and possible folder structures we can use in our projects,

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,980
especially if our projects are getting bigger

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,300
and we wanna make sure that we are quickly able to find

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,190
all our different files.

34
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,023
So with that,

35
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:36,533
let's not waste any time, and let's dive right in.
