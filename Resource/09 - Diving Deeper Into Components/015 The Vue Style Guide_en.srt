1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,939
Now let's move away from code for now.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,660
And let's talk about our folder structure

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,910
and our file names here.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,650
You probably just followed along and named your files

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,980
just like I did.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,640
But the question is, why did I choose the names

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,660
I did choose?

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,690
And is this the most optimal folder structure?

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,560
There is an official Vue Style Guide.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,510
On the Vue website, you can find it under Doc's Style Guide.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,720
And here you will get recommendations on how your code

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,170
should look like, how you should name certain things.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,830
There are essential rules which you basically

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,200
have to follow.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,900
And then there are various levels of recommendations

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,520
like strongly recommended rules you might want to

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,380
consider following, and then just generally

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,410
recommended ones.

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,210
Now you can read through that to get an idea

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,510
for how you should name things.

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,290
For example, in data you'll learn that

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,840
components should be stored in files,

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,040
so one component per file.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,150
You'll learn that you have base components, like the card

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,700
which you might use in different places,

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,760
which you then should name, BaseButton, BaseCard,

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,690
and so on, or AppButton AppCard,

28
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,530
whatever you prefer, here.

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,330
You will learn about single instance component names

30
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,840
like our header here, which I named TheHeader,

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,620
following the style guide here, where it's recommended

32
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,730
that if you have a component, which is only getting used

33
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,790
once in the entire app, the name should be

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,810
The, and then something that describes the component.

35
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,410
Now throughout the course, I will follow this style guide

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,490
as good as possible.

37
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,690
I will also say though, that from time to time,

38
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,440
I might deviate, to explain something in a better way

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,230
or to have an easier time explaining something,

40
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,663
but generally I follow that guide.

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,190
And you can go through it as well to get some ideas

42
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,170
on how you want to name your things.

43
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,070
And which kind of code you want to write

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,623
when you work with Vue on your own.

45
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,900
Be aware of though, that these are not technical rules,

46
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,150
but really just recommendations.

47
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,280
So if you don't want to follow a certain rule, that is fine.

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,730
It's your project, you don't have to adhere to those rules,

49
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,920
especially if you're working on your own.

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,220
If you are working in a bigger project with a team,

51
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,580
or if you are planning to share your code

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,070
with others though, you should consider following this guide

53
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,600
so that everyone is basically working with the same rules

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,030
in mind on the code base.

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,170
And that's all I want to say about the style guide

56
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,650
at this point, because this is a course where

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,150
I wanna teach you Vue and where I want to focus on Vue,

58
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,770
the framework and the features it offers.

59
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,310
And as I mentioned, I will follow this style guide anyways,

60
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,920
so by just following along with the lectures

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,510
and this course, you will automatically get a feeling

62
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,210
for how to name things, how to write code

63
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,703
and how to write good code.
