1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,340
Slots are a powerful feature,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,800
but now we broke the styling.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,640
We broke the styling of our user info component here

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,283
where the batch should be next to the title,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,350
because we previously targeted this header here

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,510
to apply our styling.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,130
Now we're sending this content into a header,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,940
but into a header of a different component

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,533
of the BaseCard component.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,409
Now you could think that the content that sent

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,560
into a header is to find in the component

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,440
where this styling is scoped to

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,650
and (murmurs) the component it's being sent

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,920
to the BaseCard component

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,890
should be affected by this styling as well.

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,840
But that's not how Vue works.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,530
There is a very simple rule

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,170
when working with slots

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,510
and when sending content into other components slots,

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,720
nothing changes about what

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,510
you learned regarding scoped styles,

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,160
availability of data and props and so on.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,800
For example, fullName, this prop here,

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,980
which we have available and UserInfo,

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,360
is also still only available here in UserInfo.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,800
It's not a available in BaseCard,

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,783
even though we are sending this markup to BaseCard.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,130
But Vue.js will analyze, compile

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,690
and evaluate this template before it sends to content

30
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,380
to the other component so to say.

31
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,990
So therefore, here we have access

32
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,870
to whatever is defined inside of UserInfo,

33
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,660
and to styling defined here

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,240
also affects this markup,

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,080
but not the markup of any component

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,543
we might be sending our content to.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,920
That's how this works.

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,520
And that's why this header style here,

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,160
does not affect the header in base card.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,000
So if you want to affect this header, of course

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,720
what we should do is grab this selector,

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,150
remove it in UserInfo and therefore,

43
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,000
since we have no styles left,

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,070
removed the entire style tag

45
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,400
and go to BaseCard instead,

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,610
and then in the scoped styling there,

47
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,653
we can add the header styling.

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,210
And with that, we got the look from before,

49
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,170
because now we moved the styling

50
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,463
to the appropriate place.
