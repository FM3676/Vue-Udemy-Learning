1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,070
That was another long module

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,540
about components.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,800
But we're never done with components.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,170
We now know all the core features you need to know

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,360
and in the next module, we are going to practice

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,700
all the features we learned in this

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,720
and the previous modules by building a complete project.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,450
A complete app.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,500
Now in this module, we had a look at

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,320
component registration and styles.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,060
And you learned that components

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,120
can be registered globally or locally.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,010
Globally with the app component method,

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,560
locally by importing them and adding them

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,880
to the components option in the conflict object

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,040
of a component or app.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,160
You should prefer local registration for most components.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,480
But if you have components which you are using

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,020
in a lot of different places off your app,

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,883
then of course global registration makes a lot of sense.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,680
We also had a look at styling

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,580
and styling can also be global or scoped.

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,280
Global styles affect all HTML elements,

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,810
no matter in which component they are.

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,200
And scoped styles only affect the HTML elements

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,770
in the template off the component where you are using them.

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,560
You should prefer scoped styles for most components.

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,250
But definitely set up global application wide styles,

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,370
like a font family in a unscoped style tag

30
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,323
in your app.Vue file.

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,050
We also had a look at slots, another key feature.

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,270
Slots can in the end be used as a placeholder

33
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,280
for dynamic HTML code

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,030
which can then be inserted from outside into a component.

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,930
You can have single slots.

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,760
You can have multiple slots

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,210
where you then also need names.

38
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,680
Only one slot may stay unnamed.

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,390
You can provide default content for slots,

40
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,470
which will be used as a fallback

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,449
if no content is provided for that slot from outside.

42
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,960
And we learned about scope slots

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,323
for some advanced use cases.

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,280
Slots are another key feature

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,920
which unlock rapper components like cards or dialogs,

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,503
and you will see them in action again in the next module.

47
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,140
We also have dynamic components.

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,820
Dynamic components is a feature built in

49
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,933
to view unlocked with the built-in component.

50
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,700
This can be used to dynamically swap it

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,320
for different components you defined.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,910
And you can also control the caching of that component

53
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,570
with the built-in keep alive component

54
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,730
as you learned it in this module.

55
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,470
We will also use this feature in the next course module.

56
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,903
So, in the project we're going to build there.

57
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,120
Now last but not least, we have a look at teleport

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,300
and the official style guide.

59
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,780
Teleport is another built-in component which can be used to

60
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,900
manipulate the DOM structure and control

61
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,820
where something is added to the real DOM,

62
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,100
whilst keeping your component hierarchy.

63
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,603
So that will not be changed by teleport.

64
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,872
And last but not least,

65
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:22,360
I introduced you to the official style guide.

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,030
And you might want to consider following that

67
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,810
or at least have a look at it

68
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,720
to keep your code clean and understandable.

69
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,460
And that's it for this module.

70
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,670
In the next module we're going to practice

71
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,793
what we learned here and in the previous modules.
