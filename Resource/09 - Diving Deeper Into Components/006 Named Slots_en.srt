1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,990
So now that we learned about slots,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,930
we can of course use our base-card slot

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,010
also here in the BadgeList.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,260
There, I also got a section

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,330
which should have this card look.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,480
So we can remove this section styling here,

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,990
not the h2 styling.

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,560
I wanna keep that exclusive to this component,

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,890
but the section styling

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,780
and then use our base-card component here to wrap this,

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,903
on all the list in the h2 tag in our case.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,290
So use base-card as a wrapper around this content

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,800
and that will now ensure that again it looks like before,

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,960
but now we have this re-usable card component

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,603
and we can use it wherever we need that look.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,250
But that's not even all, you can use slots for it.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,420
It is nice that we're able to pass dynamic content

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,430
between the opening and closing tags of our own component.

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,100
But sometimes you also have the scenario

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,063
that your custom component should have multiple slots.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,840
And actually, I can show this here

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,660
at the example of this BaseCard.

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,820
At the moment it has one slot,

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,550
but it would not be unrealistic

25
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,410
that it should have two slots,

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,940
let's say one slot for the header

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,123
and one slot for the main content.

28
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,280
So here in BaseCard, we could add a header component

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,340
to ensure that we always have the same structure

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,410
for every card, for example

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,893
and then here, we also want to add a slot like this.

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,930
But of course now we have two slots

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,840
and therefore Vue wouldn't really know

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,500
where the provided content should go.

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,540
So that's why if you use more than one slot,

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,200
you can add names to slots

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,763
with the name, attribute on the slot element.

38
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,280
And here we could give this a name of header,

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,690
but that name is up to you.

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,100
It can be anything,

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,100
doesn't have to be the wrapping elements' name.

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,509
You don't have to name all slots.

43
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,930
If you leave one unnamed slot,

44
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,010
that will be the default slot,

45
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,990
but you must only have one unnamed slot.

46
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,060
And now you can assign the content to the different slots,

47
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,150
for example in UserInfo,

48
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,510
we could now go to our header here

49
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,800
and now here I want to tell Vue that this content,

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,790
the h3 tag and the base tag

51
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,900
should go to the header slot

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,110
and for that you wrap it with a template tag,

53
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,120
which is a default HTML element

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,320
and on that template tag,

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,560
which holds the content that should go into your name slot,

56
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,170
you add a special directive, the v-slot directive.

57
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,910
The v-slot directive can be used to let Vue know

58
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,223
where certain content should go to.

59
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,640
Now, you will let Vue know where the content should go to

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
by adding an argument to this directive,

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,370
which you do by adding a colon,

62
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,780
and then the name of your slot.

63
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,910
Now I have a named slot with a name of header here

64
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,880
and therefore we can add header as an argument here.

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,380
And this tells Vue that the content inside of the template

66
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,083
will go to this named slot.

67
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,490
Now as a side note,

68
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,120
the template is a default HTML tag,

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,760
which doesn't render anything to the screen though,

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,983
which is why we use it as a container here.

71
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,920
Now, if you then have content left,

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,790
which is not in a template with the slot,

73
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,763
that content will automatically go to the default slot.

74
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,480
So if I save that,

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,510
it looks almost like before,

76
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,350
but we can tell that something changed

77
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,470
because now the label, the badge here

78
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,890
is no longer next to the name

79
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,070
and it is no longer next to the name

80
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,200
because we no longer have the header here in UserInfo,

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,310
instead, we have the template where we sent this content

82
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,113
into the header of BaseCard.

83
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,180
And since the header's styling,

84
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,570
which was responsible

85
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,250
for placing the badge next to the title

86
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,529
is still in UserInfo and is scoped to this component,

87
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,670
it does not affect the header in BaseCard.

88
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,470
We're going to take care about styling

89
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,930
in the next lecture though.

90
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,520
Before we do that, however,

91
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,580
let me go to BadgeList

92
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,660
and here I want to send this h2 tag into the header.

93
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,493
So again, we need a template,

94
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,520
wrap h2 with it, and then add v-slot:header.

95
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,310
You can also be more explicit about the fact that this here,

96
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,840
the rest will go into the default slot

97
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,583
by adding a template here,

98
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,540
adding a template around that

99
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,940
and then adding v-slot:default.

100
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
Default is a reserve name

101
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,230
and like the name implies,

102
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,893
it always targets the default slot.

103
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,610
So I'm going to do this here

104
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,800
and also in the UserInfo component

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,890
to be very clear about which content goes where

106
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,560
and to make it obvious that I did not forget

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,740
to assign this to any slot,

108
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,843
but that I want this to go to the default slot.

109
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,970
So that's why I add this default slot template

110
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,520
to both UserInfo and BadgeList here.

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
But with that, that's what we got.

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,280
Now let's explore the styling here

113
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,563
and let's see how we can fix this when working with slots.
