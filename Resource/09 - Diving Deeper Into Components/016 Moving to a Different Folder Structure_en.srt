1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,430
Now the style guide is one thing.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,130
It helps you write good code,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,620
it helps you name your files.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,520
But there's another aspect

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,710
that you should keep in mind

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,140
if you're working on bigger projects

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,479
and that is related to how you organize your files.

8
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:21,010
(indistinct), we have to source folder,

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,730
and in there we have a components folder

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,360
with all our review components.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,230
This is a typical structure

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,290
and there's nothing wrong with it,

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,950
but in bigger projects,

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,710
this of course we'll reach certain limits.

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,130
If you have a project with hundreds of components,

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,870
having them all in one folder,

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,920
can be very hard to manage.

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,740
You might have a hard time finding the components

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,340
you are looking for.

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,180
Therefore,

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,130
you might want to consider creating sub folders.

22
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,963
For example,

23
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:55,800
we could create a sub folder named base or UI

24
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,000
for all those base components like the card here.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,050
So I'm moving to BaseCard there.

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,903
I'm moving the BaseBadge here.

27
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,950
Of course, when you do that,

28
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,660
you want to make sure that you update

29
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,470
all the imports you're using.

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,320
So in main.js,

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,773
I'm now importing BaseBadge from components/UI/BaseBadge,

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,098
and the same for the BaseCard.

33
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:21,890
Otherwise Vue will not be able

34
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,100
to find these things

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,633
and your project will break.

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,247
Now that's the folder

37
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,990
for the general base components.

38
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,970
We could also create a subfolder

39
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,130
inside of the components folder named layout

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,510
where replace things like the header or the footer

41
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,150
if you have one.

42
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,120
So therefore of course,

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,270
make sure you also updates the import here

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,363
in app.vue in our case.

45
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,460
And then you might have various other components,

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,060
which you might want to organize by feature.

47
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,390
If you're building an online shop application,

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,470
for example,

49
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,660
you could have a subfolder named cart

50
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,850
where you have all the cart related components.

51
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,750
You could have a subfolder named checkout

52
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,250
for the checkout related components,

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,140
one named products for the components

54
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,290
that are dealing with outputting products and so on.

55
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,240
Now here I have various demo components

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,430
because this here in the end,

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,230
isn't a real app which we're building

58
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,630
and therefore I will just leave them here.

59
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,230
But in the next module,

60
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,760
we're going to use everything

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,450
we learned about components over the last modules,

62
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,730
and we're going to build a full application

63
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,740
from scratch.

64
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,150
And there you will see a proper folder structure

65
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,770
in place to manage all the components.

66
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,460
Because there will then have a real application

67
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,600
where this makes more sense.

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,560
For now, just be aware of the fact

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,170
that you might need to restructure

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,330
your folders here at some point

71
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,143
to keep your code manageable.
