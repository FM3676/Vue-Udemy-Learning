1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,920
So what's wrong with our current error dialogue here.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,290
Well if I open it,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,180
visually, everything is all right.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,740
But if I inspect this here,

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,700
we can see a problem in the HTML mark-up.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,660
Here's our dialogue right?

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,550
Its below the button input and h2 tag.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,950
And its below there, because that's where we added it

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,843
in the template of Manage Goals.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,490
Now visually as I said everything works but semantically,

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,490
and from HTML perspective,

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,270
having this,

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,240
element the dialogue,

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,250
which actually is treated as overlay to the entire page.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,350
Having that nested here,

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,350
in our HTML code,

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,110
is not ideal.

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,830
It works but for accessibility this could be strange.

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,030
You could also run into some styling bugs here

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,970
and it might simply make more sense

21
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,301
if that dialogue wouldn't be down there.

22
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:04,780
But instead lets say it would be somewhere here.

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,780
It would be inserted at the root of our HTML tree.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,510
And not deeply nested inside of it.

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,440
Really just for semantic,

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,990
and also partly accessibility reasons.

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,420
And this is something which is easy to achieve with view,

28
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,563
and a feature called Teleport.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,610
Teleport, is a built in view component

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,800
just like component

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,962
and keep alive.

32
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:34,600
You can wrap your 2B teleported thing

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,570
so your 2B rendered somewhere else thing,

34
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,740
in this case the error alert,

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,840
with the built-in Teleport element.

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,983
Which again is a built-in component view provides to you.

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,640
Now how does Teleport work

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,780
or what do you with it.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,020
Teleport wants one prop, one attribute.

40
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,710
The two prop.

41
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,150
And here you provide a CSS selector,

42
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,922
selecting an HTML element onto your entire page,

43
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:07,810
where this content should actually

44
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,370
be added to in the HTML mark-up.

45
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,220
So logically, it still belongs to this component

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,960
you can still interact with methods in that component

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,090
and so on.

48
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,410
But it will be rendered

49
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,993
somewhere else in the dome's structure.

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,120
And here for example

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,171
we could select the body element

52
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,300
by just referring to the body tag.

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,140
You could also refer to an element by an ID selector

54
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,090
like this.

55
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,310
You just pass in a regular CSS selector here.

56
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,830
And here I'll go for the body tag.

57
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,800
Which means, please render the content of this component

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,910
the actual HTML mark-up that should be added to the dome

59
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,600
please render it in the Body element,

60
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,370
directly in the body element

61
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,810
and not deeply nested in this HTML structure

62
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,483
as it was happening before.

63
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
So if I save that,

64
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,500
and reload

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,440
and generate this dialogue,

66
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,010
it looks like before.

67
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,880
But if we inspect this now, we see this dialogue

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,730
is now at the end of the body section.

69
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,260
And its no longer deeply nested in this

70
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,813
div or any other elements.

71
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:20,090
And semantically this can be better.

72
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,740
Its of course a small optimization

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,170
it might not matter to you

74
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,194
and you don't have to use teleport if you don't want to.

75
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:30,730
But as you can tell it's super easy to use.

76
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,870
And it may help you with

77
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,230
the overall HTML structure

78
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,130
and ensure that

79
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,930
you don't just create an application that looks nice

80
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,410
and works correctly

81
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,390
but it also uses a semantically correct HTML structure

82
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,300
under the wood.

83
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,503
And teleport makes that easy, as you can tell.
