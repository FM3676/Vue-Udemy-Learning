1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,700
I got a another starting project for you,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,620
which you'll find attached to this lecture, of course.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,870
In there run npm install.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,130
Once you downloaded it to install all the dependencies

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,100
and then with npm run serv like always,

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,400
you can bring up that development server

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,533
and see this application on the screen.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,760
And here is what you should see on the screen

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,120
once you load that, it's a very basic dummy application.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,710
It has no real purpose and it also has no interactivity.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,030
We can't do anything on this page as a user,

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,560
but it allows me to dive deeper into components

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,390
and show you some other core features.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,220
And we're then going to build a complete application

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,250
from scratch and a more realistic application, of course,

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,410
in the next module once we covered those important features,

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,250
we're going to talk about in this module.

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,140
So let's dive into those features

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,500
and let me quickly walk you

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,780
through this dummy application here,

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,990
so that we're all on the same page.

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,320
In main.js I'm importing and registering

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,270
a couple of components, the components you find here.

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,160
In App.vue I'm using The-Header-Component,

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,130
there's Badge-List-Component,

26
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,590
and also the User-Info-Component.

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,920
To user-info, we're passing some data via props.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
The data here is coming from inside the data object

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,710
we have in our App.vue files,

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,330
so in this configuration for our main app.

31
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,160
And then in the components, in UserInfo,

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,970
I'm getting those props

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,580
and then I'm just outputting them here.

34
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,840
I'm using the Base-Badge-Component here

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,900
and I'm passing more props to that.

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,650
The Base-Badge-Component also just has some basic markup.

37
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,580
It's responsible for displaying these badges here,

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,980
ADMIN and AUTHOR, which you can see on the screen.

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,120
And in the Base-Badge-Component,

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,110
I just got a computed property

41
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,600
for deriving this dynamic CSS class object,

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,050
which is bound to the class attribute here.

43
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,950
And I also got some styling.

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,783
Actually,

45
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:10,650
I got some styling in a couple of those components.

46
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,450
The Badge-List-Component just shows all available badges

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,900
in an onward of list.

48
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,270
So here we're using the base-badge again.

49
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,170
So we're not just using BaseBadge in the UserInfo,

50
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,410
but also in the Badge-List-Component.

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,520
And The-Header-Component is a very simple component

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,490
where I just render and style the header,

53
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,240
we're seeing on this page.

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,240
So let's now see what we can learn about components,

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,033
which we haven't learned already.
