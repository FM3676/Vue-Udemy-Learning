1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,040
There's another feature

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,870
or aspect about components you should be aware of.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,990
In some components, like the header here,

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,720
we have only one root HTML element,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,520
like the header element here,

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,750
and all our elements, in this case,

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,293
the only other element, h1, are child elements of that.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,290
In other components, like managed goals on the other hand,

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,280
we theoretically have multiple top-level HTML elements,

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,830
at least if I remove that div here.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,300
And it is important to know,

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,330
to be aware of the fact that this is okay,

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,910
and I'm highlighting this because in Vue two,

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,850
this was actually not supported.

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,900
In Vue.js version two, you were required

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,470
to have one root level element per template,

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,940
and then, in there, you could have

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,750
as many sibling elements as you wanted to.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,840
In Vue free, this changed,

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
and now, you can have as many

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,190
top-level elements as you want.

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,010
So if you don't need a wrapping element for semantic

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,370
or styling reasons, there is no reason to keep one around.

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,600
This is a feature called fragments.

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,073
You are allowed to have multiple top-level elements now.
