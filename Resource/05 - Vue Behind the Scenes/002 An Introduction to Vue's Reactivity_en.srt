1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,490
Now for this module,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,930
I prepared another very simple project for you.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,260
You find it attached.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,570
And there I already have a simple Vue app

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,670
created with create app

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,219
where we have two pieces of data,

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,150
the current user input and the message

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,310
where we have two methods.

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,880
One to change the current user input

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,900
to the event target value.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,756
And one to set the current message

12
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,770
to the current user input.

13
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,890
And all of that is connected to some HTML code.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,350
That is the section we're controlling with Vue.

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,670
This is what triggers to save input method.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,400
Here we triggered a set text method

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,680
and here we output the message.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,260
And then we've got some styles,

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,160
which we of course can ignore though.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,333
These are largely the styles you already know anyways.

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,030
Now this app here is very simple,

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,380
Vue is awesome is something I can enter here.

23
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,830
And if I click set text, that's the message showing up here.

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,830
And that is achieved with a combination of data methods

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,070
and then of course, event bindings

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,450
that triggered the methods

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,310
and interpolation to output the message data.

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,200
Now, that's all something you'll learn about in this course,

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,280
and I'm not going to bore you by repeating this again here.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,300
If that is still unclear, you should go through

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,803
the previous lectures and modules again.

32
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,750
Now, what I wanna explore here

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,220
is how Vue does this behind the scenes.

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,090
This automatic updating here.

35
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,800
If we changed the text here and set it,

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,800
this part of the page, we as a user see, is updated by Vue.

37
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,150
And that's this built in reactivity, which Vue has,

38
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,490
which is one of its core features.

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,360
Essentially viewed as one important thing.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,360
The data you define here is something Vue keeps track of.

41
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,200
I mentioned before that it would take this data object here

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,200
and merge all your properties in here into a global

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,840
behind the scenes managed object,

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,670
the same object where your methods

45
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,543
are merged into by the way.

46
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,820
And indeed, this is what is happening

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,630
behind the scenes by Vue.

48
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,110
It also does other things like ensuring

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,300
that this points at this global object,

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,100
but when it comes to the data,

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,473
the important and key thing which Vue does

52
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:42,473
is it turns your data object into a reactive data object

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,390
by essentially wrapping your properties

54
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,810
with a JavaScript feature called Proxies.

55
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,170
in JavaScript there's a built in feature,

56
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,090
which is called Proxy,

57
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,890
which Vue leverages under the hood

58
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,590
to wrap your properties here and to be notified

59
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,260
whenever you assign a new value,

60
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,200
like here with message.

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,120
When I set a new value to message,

62
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,794
no matter if data is another data property

63
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:16,200
or a hard coded string like this,

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,200
no matter what it is, when you assign a new value to message

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,020
Vue is made aware of that.

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,370
And that's important.

67
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,780
If Vue would not be notified about this new assignment,

68
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,960
it could not go ahead and update what you see on the screen.

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,060
It needs to be notified by changes like this

70
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,210
so that it recognizes that it should scan

71
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,140
the controlled HTML code for a use

72
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,740
such as ofted changed property

73
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,250
like here, messages being used here.

74
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,020
And then when it sees those usages

75
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,310
and it knows that message changed,

76
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,800
it goes out to the rendered page

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,540
to the screen the user sees,

78
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,400
it goes to that screen

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,330
and finds the appropriate place there

80
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,700
where this dynamic content is displayed

81
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,550
and updated there on the screen as well.

82
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,850
And that's this built in reactivity,

83
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,283
which Vue does and uses behind the scenes.

84
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,950
Now, how does that work though?

85
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,270
I mentioned that a feature called Proxies would be used.

86
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,493
Let's explore data in greater detail.
