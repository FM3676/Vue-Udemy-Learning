1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,470
So we can have multiple apps,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,600
and I already mentioned that we control different parts

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,560
of the HTML code.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,630
Now, of course, it should be needless to say

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,140
that you shouldn't control the same HTML part

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,180
with different apps.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,120
And you also can't use one app

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,760
to control multiple HTML parts.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
It's one HTML part per app.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,770
And also, the term HTML part

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,770
or controlled HTML is not entirely correct though I used it,

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,618
because I think it's easy to understand.

13
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:41,618
The official term is template by mounting your app,

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,440
your Vue app to a certain place in the DOM in the HTML code,

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,700
you make that part of the HTML code

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,550
the template of that Vue app.

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,550
So this section is the template of our first Vue app

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,420
which is mounted with this selector to this section,

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,980
and that other section is the template

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,600
of our second Vue app.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,690
And I'm emphasizing this because we're also going to hear

22
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,870
about the term template later again.

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,630
There also are different ways of defining your template

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,680
of an app.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,550
This here is definitely the most common,

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,030
and most convenient one, writing HTML code,

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,770
and then mounting your application to it,

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,360
this makes a lot of sense,

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,130
but actually, it's not the only way of adding a template,

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,500
and I wanna show this here as the example of app two.

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,640
You can also add a template to a Vue app

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,830
by adding the template option

33
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,623
to your app configuration object.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,890
This template option wants a string,

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,070
and to write multi-line strings

36
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,980
with these I will use backticks here.

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,600
Really just so that I can write multi-line code.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,510
So these are not single quotes,

39
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,250
that's a backtick which is a different character

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,080
on your keyboard.

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,240
And now we could, for example, grab this paragraph here,

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,770
and cut it from the HTML file,

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,853
and instead add it in this string here.

44
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,820
This now is the template of the second app,

45
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,350
and actually, this was the template before as well.

46
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,970
We controlled this section so anything inside

47
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,370
of the section was our template.

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,030
Now I'm just defining this differently.

49
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,430
Now we still need to mount this app

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,050
because Vue still needs to know

51
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,410
where to display this template with the actual value

52
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,830
for a favorite meal when it is rendered on the screen.

53
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,560
So we still need to mount it otherwise Vue wouldn't know

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,100
where to add this paragraph on the page.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,280
But with that if I save it and reload,

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,430
you'll see the same output as before.

57
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,410
The template is just defined differently.

58
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,930
Now in reality you will most

59
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,230
often use the approach we used this far.

60
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,540
We get nicer syntax highlighting there,

61
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,200
it's easier to understand,

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,990
and there is no great reason

63
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,453
for using this string based template.

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,760
We will however, learn about a different way

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,680
of defining a template and of writing Vue code in general,

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,540
in a couple of modules,

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,100
not a drastic change,

68
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,000
but a nicer way of doing that.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,310
So that's also why I'm emphasizing

70
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,653
this template part right now already.

71
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,800
For the moment, just be aware of this template concept,

72
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,110
and that of course, there's nothing wrong

73
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,200
with the approach we used before,

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,370
but that with that approach we

75
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,040
in the end made all the content

76
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,620
of the Vue controlled HTML part the template of that app

77
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,963
that controlled that part.
