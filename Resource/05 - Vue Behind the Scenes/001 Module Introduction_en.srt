1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,260
Knowing the basics about Vue,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,960
which we do by now, is of course important.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,530
It's the most important part,

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,450
but in my opinion, it's also important

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,940
that you understand what Vue does behind the scenes,

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,960
how it works behind the scenes.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,760
And that is exactly what we're going to explore

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,520
in this module.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,370
Now, I will say this module is optional.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,610
At least the majority of it.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,690
There are free lectures, which you should not skip.

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,250
The lecture about Refs

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,010
and the two lectures about the Vue app lifecycle.

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,550
You can skip the rest of the module for now,

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,050
if you're not interested,

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,130
though I strongly recommend that you don't skip it,

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,480
or you at least come back later,

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,870
but you will definitely get the most out of this course

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,360
if you go through this module right now.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,690
I mean, after all, that is why I did add it

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,020
at this point of time in the course,

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,790
because having that extra behind the scenes knowledge

23
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,300
will help you overall as a Vue developer.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,680
Because if you understand the tool you're working with,

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,600
you're able to work with it better.

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,340
Specifically in this module, we will explore

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,600
how Vue works under the hood,

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,560
how it's reactivity system works under the hood,

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,880
and we'll also understand

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,800
how it uses a concept called the Virtual DOM,

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,583
to efficiently update what you see on the screen.
