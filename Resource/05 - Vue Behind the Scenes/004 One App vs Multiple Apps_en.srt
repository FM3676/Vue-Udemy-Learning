1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,240
Now that we explored reactivity.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,890
I already want to leave it.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,590
I already want to leave this example

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,880
because that really is all I think we should know for now

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,129
of how View's reactivity works under the hood.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,170
It's not all we should know about View in general, though;

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,930
for example, you might have wondered

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,880
if you can only have one view app per page,

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,500
and maybe you already tried out working with multiple apps

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,040
because yes, you can have multiple apps. Here,

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,980
and thus far in all the lectures and modules,

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,680
we just haven't had one app

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,070
and we mounted that to one part of our HTML code,

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,140
which would then be controlled by that app.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,670
But you can absolutely have more than one app

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,520
if you wanted to.

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,640
So if we add a second section here with an idea

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,640
of app two, we can absolutely create a second app,

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,633
maybe name it app two here with View Create App,

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,530
which we mount to this app two ID section.

21
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,750
And in here, we can do the exact same thing

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,503
as we did in our first app.

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,700
We can also return the data object here.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,360
We can have a data property here, like a favorite meal,

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,070
pizza and, we can then of course, output this here,

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,480
in our second app, the favorite meal.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,400
If we do all of that and saved it and reload,

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,210
here is our second app.

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,540
Now it's missing the styling

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,540
because I actually set the styling up to target the app ID.

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,770
But if we would target the app two ID as well,

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,730
we would get the exact same styling as before.

33
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,680
So, if you quickly find all the places into styled CSS file,

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,290
where we target the app ID selector,

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,853
simply add the two ID selector with a comma as well.

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,250
Also, here and here. And of course all the 40 input.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,720
If you plan on using one in your second app

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,230
and all the other styles.

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,620
Now, since I don't use a buttons on in my second app,

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,120
I'll omit this. And with that,

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,500
if I reload, we see this in a nicer style.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,610
Now, of course, you can't use data from another app.

43
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,510
So, here in my app, two, in this section,

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,460
which is controlled by the second app,

45
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,760
I can't output the message,

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
which is part of the data of the first app.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,140
This does not work. If I do that, you see nothing here,

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,410
because the message is not a data property

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,640
of the second app.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,250
It's one of the first app.

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,020
And these two apps have no connection,

52
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,830
which is important, by the way.

53
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,880
Each view app works stand alone.

54
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,560
There is no connection between them.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,550
These are really two different parts

56
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,900
of your HTML code, controlled

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,780
by two different apps with no connection between the apps.

58
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,900
So this here does not work,

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,633
because this is the data from another app.

60
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,130
And therefore, multiple View apps

61
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,720
are definitely something you might want to use.

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,140
If you have different independent parts on your screen,

63
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,110
that should be controlled by View.

64
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,800
If you have a part that needs to work together,

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,060
though, for example, an input,

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,500
which is connected to the button,

67
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,590
which ultimately influences what's in the paragraph.

68
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,120
If you that, then this all should be controlled

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,223
by the same app. Of course.
