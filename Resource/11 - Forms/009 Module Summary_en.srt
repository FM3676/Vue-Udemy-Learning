1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,660
And that is it for this module.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,740
We had another look at v-model,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,150
and how we can use it to get user input,

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,820
but also how we can manipulate this user input,

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,463
for example, to reset it.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,730
We had a first look at validating user input,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,750
and how we could show an error message

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,780
before the forum was submitted,

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,430
which is not a must to do,

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,920
but simply an option you could use.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,070
And we had to look at different inputs,

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,150
different ways of using v-model

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,960
with trim or with number inputs.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,620
We had to look at using v-model

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,910
with selects, with check boxes,

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,720
both groups of check boxes and single check boxes.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,663
And we had a look at radio buttons.

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,670
And last but not least,

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,410
you learned how to build your own control on

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,600
which you can use v-model thanks to this special prop

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
and to special event, which v-model uses under the hood

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,553
if you use it on a custom component.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,350
And that's all we got to know about forms for now,

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,560
with that, you should have a pretty good toolbox full

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,130
of useful tools that help you build the user experiences

26
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,203
you need in your applications.
