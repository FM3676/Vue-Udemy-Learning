1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, it would be nice

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,270
if we could use our own control, the rating control,

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,570
just like the built in inputs.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,310
So if I could use the model on this

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,410
and then simply bind the value

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,620
that this control has internally

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,120
to some data property I store here

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,400
so that I have a rating here initially, it's null,

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,400
and I bind rating with v-model to the rating control.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,710
It would be nice if we could use it like this.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,740
And we can, you might remember

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,200
that at the beginning of the course

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
relatively at the beginning,

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,060
I explained that v-model on an input element was

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,460
in the end, just a short cut.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,050
It was a short cut for a manually listening

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,900
to the input event and binding the value attribute.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,670
You might remember this.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,950
I mentioned this at the beginning v-model is

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,140
just a shortcut for this

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,930
and that's something we can leverage.

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,840
Now the input event and the value prop.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,253
That's specific to input elements here,

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,780
but if you use v-model on a custom component,

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,810
that is something which is supported by Vue

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,390
and Vue will set a very specific prop.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,670
If you use v-model on a component,

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,880
it will set the very specific prop in that component.

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,650
And it will listen to a very specific event,

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,803
which you can emit in that component.

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,450
Now, which prop is that and which event is that?

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,660
Let's go to rating control,

33
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,550
as I just said, v-model we'll set a specific prop.

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,060
So therefore we should declare that prop

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,473
and that prop, which will be set is the model value prop.

36
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,320
So using v-model on a custom component is

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,280
like manually binding the model-value prop like this

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,660
that's one thing v-model does

39
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,393
under the hood on custom components.

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,460
The other thing is the special event that's submitted

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,520
that is the update model value.

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,110
Yes, this looks strange,

43
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,620
but you can name your events, however you want.

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,990
And this is the name Vue will be waiting for,

45
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,230
when you use v-model on a custom component.

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,510
So using v-model here is like manually binding model value,

47
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,850
the model value prop and listening

48
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,123
to the update model value custom event.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,800
If you use that,

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,223
it's the same as if you use v-model.

51
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,420
So therefore, if we accept this prop in our component

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,780
and emit this event, we can use v-model on our component

53
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,680
and therefore back rating control.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,950
All we got to do here is we have to emit

55
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,090
this update model value event in our activate method.

56
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,883
And forward this option to v-model,

57
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,950
and also initialize our active option

58
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,650
with the model value we get on the prop here,

59
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,520
so that the form component.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,600
So this component here is able to set our initial value

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,090
so that this rating initial value here,

62
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,320
which we bind to v-model is the initial value reflected

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,583
in our component.

64
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:39,020
And if we do all of that,

65
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,910
we can go back to the form

66
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,243
and now start console logging this console log rating,

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,130
and console log this rating therefore whoops, this rating,

68
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,470
and also reset rating to null their after

69
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,053
and see whether that works.

70
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,910
And if we reload,

71
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,770
we can choose our different options.

72
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,700
But if I submit this,

73
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,110
we also see the option we picked here being output

74
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,143
in the console.

75
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,050
Now, what we also see though is

76
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,030
that resetting doesn't seem to work.

77
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,850
If I submit this, I do set rating back to null here,

78
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,903
but unfortunately this does not reset it here.

79
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,060
And therefore our visual feedback is not in sync

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,133
with the value stored in rating here.

81
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,380
Now, why is this happening?

82
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,160
Well, because we only use the model value prop

83
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,350
to initialize active option,

84
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,240
but there after the model value is not reflected

85
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,920
in our active option here.

86
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,623
And that's of course a problem.

87
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,843
We can work around that though.

88
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,280
Instead of using the data here,

89
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,920
which wouldn't react to changes in our model value,

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,960
which come from outside,

91
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,479
we can simply use a computed property here.

92
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,713
We can set up active option as a computed property.

93
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,003
Now what's my idea here?

94
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,740
Well, we are emitting this event here.

95
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,830
Whenever we pick a new option.

96
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,930
And this event is picked up by the model

97
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,060
and the option which we picked will

98
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,440
then be stored in our rating data property there

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,653
because it's that property which be bound to rating control.

100
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,010
Now v-model works such that this value is

101
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,690
then fed back into this component.

102
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,050
So this prop value

103
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,650
the model value prop value will be updated

104
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,543
whenever we emitted this event.

105
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,660
So now we can just use active option here

106
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,920
and return this.model value,

107
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,180
or of course, skip this altogether

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,246
and just use model value

109
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:01,603
instead of active option here in the template.

110
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,540
That would also work because that holds the value,

111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,403
which we passed here to activate.

112
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,630
And of course, then inactivate,

113
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,463
we can get rid of this line as well.

114
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,563
So now if we save that and reload,

115
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,740
we can still select different options,

116
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,540
but now if you reset it, this has cleared

117
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,113
and now this stale for in sync with the rest of our form.

118
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,740
And that is how we can build custom controls.

119
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,920
We build regular components

120
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,570
and we listen to this special prop,

121
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,170
or we use this special prop

122
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,270
and we emit this special event.

123
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,003
That's the whole idea here.
