1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,810
So we got the name, we got the age,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,180
what about this drop down this select component?

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,580
How can we get the value there?

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,080
Well, good news V-Model works on select

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,730
just as it does on input elements.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,173
So you can use V-Model in exactly the same way.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,043
For that, we can add a new data property,

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,960
which I'll name referrer,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,940
because I'm getting the referrer

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,850
or I'm finding out how a user was referred to our page

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,623
and I want to bind this to this select drop down.

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,570
For this we can just add V-Model

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,750
and bind this to referrer,

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,153
so to this data property I just added.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,630
And then these values here,

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,150
which are set on the individual options

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,623
will be stored in referrer whenever we change a value.

18
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,020
Since we're dealing with a drop down here, though,

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,970
We might not really want to start with an empty value here

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,650
for referrer, this was fine for the text inputs,

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,700
where indeed, the inputs are empty at the beginning.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,700
But in the drop down,

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,980
we want to start with a default choice.

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,420
And to do that, we should have a look at the values

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,190
that are used behind the scenes for these options

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,770
and pick our favorite starting value,

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,623
maybe word of mouth, so the wom identifier.

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,560
And that's then the value which I want to store initially

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,253
here in the referrer.

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,230
It's also the value to which I want to reset it here.

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,133
So I will console log referrer and output this referrer.

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,810
All that a plus here,

33
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,803
enter after set this referrer equal to wom.

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,430
Was that if we saved as you see word of mouth

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,030
is pre selected if we reload

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,390
and I can change this,

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,600
and if I save that we get referrer Google here.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,140
And I'm getting referrer Google because I've changed it

39
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,070
to Google before I submitted this,

40
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,770
just in case you were confused.

41
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,010
If I submitted with word of mouth selected,

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,893
I get the word of mouth identifier here.

43
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,480
So that is how easy it is

44
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,233
to get values for a select drop down with a view.
