1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,846
We also got checkboxes

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,939
and radio buttons.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,100
The difference being that for checkboxes,

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,610
we can select as many as we want at the same time

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,210
for radio buttons we can only select one

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,370
at the same time if they share the same name attribute,

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,433
which they do here.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,060
So, we can add data properties for this as well,

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,360
because it turns out we can use v-model here as well.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,710
So we got our interest checkboxes

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,300
and then our how radio buttons.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,520
Hence I'll add two new data properties here.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,630
Interest and set this to null initially

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,730
and how and set this to null initially.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,080
And how can we now use v-model for that?

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,510
Well, we simply go to our inputs.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,860
Let's start with the checkboxes.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,090
And then on every input we can add v-model.

19
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,830
By the way, you don't always have to add it at the end.

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,623
You can add it anywhere in this attribute list.

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,470
And now simply reference the data property

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,490
where this should be stored, in my case interest.

23
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,230
And we do this on every input here on every checkbox

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,960
and the same for the radio buttons.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,920
Here it's how that was the data property I added.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,253
So let's do that here on all the radio buttons.

27
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,000
And with that added let's see what's inside those values

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,970
when we submit the form.

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,950
So here I'll console.log

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,130
my checkboxes

31
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,770
and then thereafter console.log this.interest

32
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,330
to see what's in there.

33
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,630
And I will console.log the Radio buttons

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,223
and then console.log this.how to see what was in there.

35
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,703
And I also wanna reset that.

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,370
So thereafter I'll set this.interest back to null

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,333
and this.how back to null.

38
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,933
And we will see whether that works.

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,460
If I save that, this is what we got.

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,350
Now, it's like news

41
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,020
and oh, it's now always selecting everything here.

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,343
So what's wrong here?

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,230
Well, if you got multiple checkboxes

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,250
with the same name as I do here,

45
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,360
this automatically creates a group of those checkboxes.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,430
This is fine, but we need to handle it differently.

47
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,490
In this case,

48
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,930
we should create an empty array as a starting value here

49
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,181
and Vue will then add all the checked elements

50
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,348
to this array.

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,773
So we do this here and we reset it to an empty array here.

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,920
We now reload.

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
We can check these individually.

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,070
However, you'll notice that it still behaves strangely.

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,113
If I, for example uncheck one then all get unchecked.

56
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,740
Because we need to make one adjustment here

57
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,920
we need to add values to those checkboxes here.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,330
And these values need to differ

59
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,480
because otherwise Vue doesn't know which value to add

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
to this array.

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,110
So here I'll add a value of news,

62
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,030
here a value of tutorials,

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,033
and then here a value of nothing.

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,670
And I'll reformat this to make it a bit easier to read.

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,160
So these are my checkboxes

66
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,900
and I edited this value attribute now,

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,380
which is a default HTML attribute

68
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,420
giving every checkbox a unique identifier,

69
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,123
which is used behind the scenes.

70
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,370
And it will already do the same here

71
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,430
for the radio buttons.

72
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,630
I'll also give those individual values.

73
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,170
For example, the first one receives a value of video.

74
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,520
Next one receives blogs.

75
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,580
And the last one here receives other.

76
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,780
And then I'll save that.

77
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,290
If we now reload this again, I can check them individually.

78
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,660
and they now really work on their own

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,300
also the radio buttons.

80
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,240
And if we save this,

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,100
we see for the radio buttons, video was selected,

82
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,870
thereafter it was cleared because we reset everything,

83
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,500
but that was what I did select before.

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,690
And for the checkboxes, we get this proxy object

85
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,570
which in the end under target has the values I had checked.

86
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,870
And just to double-check this,

87
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,910
let's pick Nothing and Tutorials here

88
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,110
and Blogs on the radio buttons.

89
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,970
If I save this we see blogs for the radio buttons

90
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,360
and for the checkboxes, we see nothing and tutorial.

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,143
So we got the keys here in an array then.

92
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,410
And that's how we can extract values

93
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,120
from checkboxes and radio buttons

94
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,963
also with v-model and with help of the value attribute.

95
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,000
Now there's all the one other case we could cover here.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,520
What if you had a single checkbox?

97
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,760
And for that I'll actually add a new div here

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,770
with class form-control,

99
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,210
right above the div with the submit button.

100
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,090
And in there we can add a input of type checkbox.

101
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,340
Give it an id of confirm-terms maybe,

102
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,150
and a name of confirm-terms,

103
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,320
because that's what I wanna use it for.

104
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,573
I'll add a label thereafter and say,

105
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,210
Agree to terms of use?

106
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,420
and point at the confirm-terms input

107
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,460
with the for attribute.

108
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,820
And now how can we get this value?

109
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,250
This is now not a group of checkboxes

110
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,173
but a single checkbox for that given name.

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,750
Well we can of course also use v-model here.

112
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,720
If I add a confirm prop here

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,680
and set this to false initially.

114
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,430
A confirm property I mean, in my data object.

115
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,700
We can bind this with v-model.

116
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,620
So here on this input,

117
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,483
which we just added, I'll add v-model and point at confirm.

118
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,600
And now let's output this as well.

119
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,120
I will console.log confirm

120
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,750
and then console.log this.confirm here.

121
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,433
So pointing at the data property we just added.

122
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,163
And thereafter I'll set this.confirm equal to false again.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,140
If we now save that and reload, here's our box.

124
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,550
And if I check this and save data, you see we get true.

125
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,963
And then since I said to false, it's reset.

126
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,560
So if you have a list, if you have a group of checkboxes

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,820
which share the same name attribute value,

128
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,760
then you get an array where all the check values

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,943
will be elements in.

130
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,570
If you have a single checkbox for a given name value,

131
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,160
then you get true or false.

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,300
And that's now really all you need to know about checkboxes,

133
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,513
v-model and how to work with this in Vue.
