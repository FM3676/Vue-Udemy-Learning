00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,080
We already did it throughout this course,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,480
but now in this module,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,260
we are going to take a closer look at handling user input

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,680
and working with forms in Vue.js because it turns out

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,190
we cannot just work with regular inputs with text inputs,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,520
but we can also work with drop-downs, with radio buttons,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,280
with checkboxes, and we can build our own form controls,

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,483
so let's see how all of that works in this module.
