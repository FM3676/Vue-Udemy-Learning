1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,970
So let's now add our first component

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,420
because this is just our main Vue app.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,900
But I mentioned before in the component introduction module,

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,180
that in Vue you have both.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,240
You have Vue apps and you have Vue components.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,580
And every component is like a mini app where you just have

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,290
the possibility of combining multiple components

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,940
into one app and where eventually covered

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,370
in the next module.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,530
Those mini apps,

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,750
those components will also be able to talk to each other

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,270
and you'll be able to build complex user interfaces

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,820
by combining different components together.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,270
Now, it is a convention that you create a new folder

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,260
and you fold another file named components

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,683
and your source folder to hold your components.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,250
Simply just to make it clear that these are now components

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,423
and not just any Vue app.

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,263
Now in here,

20
00:01:01,263 --> 00:01:06,263
I'm going to add my new FriendContact.vue file to hold

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,180
the friend-contact component,

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,480
which I want to create.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,320
You might remember that is the component we created

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,453
in the component introduction module.

25
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,930
Now, if we have a look at the file name,

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,830
just like with app.vue,

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,790
I want to make clear what's inside of this file.

28
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,830
It will be a component of otherwise,

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,930
it wouldn't be in a components folder,

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,330
but it will be the component

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,520
for displaying a friend contact.

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,710
You could name just whatever you want.

33
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,400
Could all just name it, just contact.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,320
But since I plan on naming the component

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,590
to custom HTML element FriendContact,

36
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,160
I want to reflect this and the file name as well.

37
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,720
And you could also name it like this.

38
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,910
This is the so called cab up case naming convention,

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,280
but it is more common to use this PacalCase naming,

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,130
where you have one word

41
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,580
possibly consisting of multiple words,

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,020
where you start every word,

43
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,110
including the word inside of the word

44
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,623
with a capital character.

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,990
Now inside of FriendContact.vue,

46
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,570
since it's a Vue file,

47
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,940
we can again create our template area here

48
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,923
and also our script area just like before.

49
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,530
And again, in this script area,

50
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll export a default object.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,710
This will be the configuration object for this component.

52
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,130
Because keep in mind,

53
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,120
an app component is like a small Vue app.

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,490
It takes the same configuration object.

55
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,653
So of course we need to export one.

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,120
Now in the component introduction module,

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,700
we then added a template key here to define

58
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,760
the HTML code of this component in a string.

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,370
We don't need to do this anymore.

60
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,370
We now got this template area

61
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,720
in the FriendContact of Vue file.

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,950
And that's exactly why we use those .vue files.

63
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,530
It makes it much more convenient to create such components

64
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,450
and defined their templates.

65
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,660
We don't need to do this in JavaScript strings anymore,

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,416
where we get no auto completion and which is really,

67
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,030
really just not fun.

68
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,170
So instead here,

69
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,456
I'm going to create my component markup.

70
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:23,410
So that's the same markup I used

71
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,030
in the component, introduction module, our list item,

72
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,880
and in there and h2 tag where I output

73
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,263
the friend.name,

74
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,443
and then also a button below that,

75
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,770
where I said show details though,

76
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,970
we're soon going to make this dynamic

77
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,110
and then a nested unordered list in here

78
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,053
like this,

79
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,470
whoops, like this,

80
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,240
where we then have to list items

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,470
one for the phone number,

82
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,610
one for the email address,

83
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,973
and here I have a strong tag where I say phone,

84
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,193
and then here we output friend.phone,

85
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,910
and on the second list element we say email

86
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,100
and then we output friend.email.

87
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,430
That's just the same markup we used before

88
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,603
in the component introduction module.

89
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,820
Now for this to work,

90
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,728
we need to add the data field again here

91
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:37,450
and return some data for this component,

92
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,890
which is now specific to that component,

93
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,740
and only to that component.

94
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,040
So which is independent from our main Vue app data.

95
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,570
And there we had the details or visible property,

96
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,820
which initially is false,

97
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,650
which we'll use to make this button work

98
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,163
and toggled this list.

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,040
And we had a dummy friend property,

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,020
which will later replace,

101
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,810
but where for the moment

102
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,180
I will just store manual so that

103
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,480
we can output something here.

104
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,760
Again that is something will change later though.

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,620
And now we will also need to add methods here

106
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,260
in our conflict object

107
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,710
and add a toggle details method here

108
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,240
to set this details are available

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,990
to what they're currently not.

110
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,710
And here I'm already getting

111
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,142
better IDE auto-completion

112
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:33,740
simply because we're in such a .vue file

113
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,530
and we got the virtual extension installed.

114
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,640
So that's already one first advantage in action.

115
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Which we have just by switching to this project set up,

116
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,653
with this extra view extension.

117
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,490
Now we can connect our template here

118
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,460
and add a click event listener to the button

119
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,320
where we trigger toggle details and

120
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,070
add V=if here on the onward list and check

121
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,660
if details are visible is true

122
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,423
and only showed us if it is true.

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,260
And now we've got the finished friend contact component.

124
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,360
Now we register it just as you learned it

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,290
in the Vue component introduction module.

126
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,060
In main.js, we create our app.

127
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,070
We can store this app in a constant

128
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,310
and call mount on this app,

129
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,283
but then we can also call the component method here.

130
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,160
And again, here,

131
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm now getting auto-completion by the way,

132
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,670
the IDE suggests to me that there is a component method

133
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,270
and it even tells me which arguments I should provide.

134
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,610
And we provide a name friend contact.

135
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,000
And as a second argument,

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,930
the conflict object for this component,

137
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,070
which lives in a different file

138
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,320
and therefore needs to be imported.

139
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,810
So I'm importing FriendContact from ./

140
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,090
now we need to go into the components folder

141
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,103
and in there, we have FriendContact.vue.

142
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,952
So that's the import path we need here

143
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:10,590
to reach the friend contact of your file,

144
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,360
and friend contact.

145
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,640
Now, again, in the end,

146
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,820
just points at this JavaScript object,

147
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,470
which we're exporting in the friend contact.vue file.

148
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,240
And that's now what we pass as a second argument

149
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,657
to the component method .

150
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,333
With that,

151
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,750
we unlock the friend-contact component in our app.

152
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,410
So we unlocked as custom HTML element.

153
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,380
And now in app view here in our onward list,

154
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,900
we can add friend-contact as often as we want.

155
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,503
And here I'll edit twice.

156
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,200
And if we saved it all,

157
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,000
it'll rebuild and on our connected page,

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,310
we'll see our components.

159
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,550
Without the styling,

160
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,300
because for the moment the CSS code is missing,

161
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,802
but we see our components and it works just as before.

162
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:05,270
Of course it's pretty ugly like this.

163
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,270
So let's next also see how we add styling here

164
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,650
before we then ultimately

165
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,523
learn more and new things about components.
