1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,370
Now, the Vue CLI

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,140
is not a mandatory tool.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,550
Let me really make that clear.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,550
It's not the same as the Vue framework

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,600
which we've been using thus far.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,930
It's just an additional tool,

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,910
also managed by the team behind Vue.

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,310
It simply helps us create projects

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,480
with a certain configuration

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,170
and with certain built-in tools

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,490
that give us all those nice features I was talking about

12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,210
in the last lectures.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,260
So it helps us create projects

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,360
and manage projects that allows us

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,640
to build more realistic, bigger applications.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,620
So how do we use the Vue CLI?

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,910
Well, the Vue CLI under the hood uses certain tools,

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,206
which you will need.

19
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:50,206
The most important tool, which you will need is Node.js.

20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,370
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime,

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,660
which in the end allows you

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,220
to run JavaScript code outside of the browser as well.

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,240
You could use Node.js to write server-side code

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,960
with JavaScript but that's not what we're going

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,060
to do in this course.

26
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,510
This is not a Node.js course.

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,770
So you will not learn Node.js here

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,050
and you will also not need to write any Node.js code.

29
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,590
No worries.

30
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,090
But we need Node.js installed on our machine

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,610
because the Vue CLI uses it under the hood.

32
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,710
So make sure you visit nodejs.org

33
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,040
and simply download the latest version there.

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,670
This gives you an installer,

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,830
which you can download

36
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,100
and you can simply walk through that installer

37
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,180
and confirm all the defaults.

38
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,690
It's available for all operating systems

39
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,900
and it's a really straightforward installation process.

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,530
You don't need any special settings or setup

41
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,520
or anything like that.

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,670
Simply walk through that installer

43
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,260
and install Node.js on your system,

44
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,003
no matter if you're using Windows or macOS or Linux.

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,940
Now, once this finished,

46
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,800
you've got Node.js installed,

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,490
which the Vue CLI needs,

48
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,100
but you've also got this npm tool installed here.

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,490
That's another tool that comes together with Node.js.

50
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,300
Npm stands for Node Package Manager

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,170
and that's a tool which we're also going to use,

52
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,920
for example, to install the Vue CLI on our system,

53
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,710
but also later to install extra packages

54
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,600
into our project which we might need.

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,340
I'll come back to that when we need it.

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,740
So let's finish that installation

57
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,340
and let's now see how we install the Vue CLI.

58
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,140
For that, we can to installation, the official docs

59
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,820
but it's really straightforward.

60
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,100
You need Node installed, as I mentioned,

61
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,040
and then once you did install Node,

62
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,350
you can run this command here

63
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,290
in the terminal or command prompt of your system.

64
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,860
So open up your system terminal or command prompt.

65
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,930
Every operating system comes with one.

66
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,470
So here I'm in the macOS terminal.

67
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,460
On Windows, you would use the Windows command prompt.

68
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,460
And in there, run npm install -g @vue/cli.

69
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,130
Like this.

70
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,140
On Mac and Linux, you might need to add sudo

71
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,440
in front of this to get the right permissions.

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,900
On Windows, this is not required

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,530
and actually also will not work.

74
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,530
So on Windows, it's just npm install -g @vue/cli.

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,720
Now, once you entered this command, hit Enter.

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,690
Maybe enter your password if you're prompted for it.

77
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,040
And now this will go ahead

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,040
and install this Vue CLI tool globally on your system

79
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,360
so that we can thereafter use it

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,200
to generate Vue projects with it.

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,623
So let's wait for this installation to finish.

82
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,520
Now, once it finished successfully,

83
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,940
which you can tell by the fact

84
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,180
that you see a message like this towards the end

85
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,620
of this output,

86
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,830
once it finished,

87
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,080
you can find a place on your system

88
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,370
where you wanna create a new project.

89
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,170
And with find a place,

90
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,980
I mean here in the terminal.

91
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,300
You can navigate around with the cd command

92
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,160
in case you're not sure about that

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,420
and make sure you pick up some terminal

94
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,415
or command prompt basics.

95
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,930
Now, once you've found that place on your system,

96
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,610
so the path on your system

97
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,740
where you wanna create a new project,

98
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,899
for me, it's in the udemy folder somewhere on my system,

99
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,660
you can run vue create to create a new project folder

100
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,800
and a new Vue app therefore in that place.

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,274
And then pick any name of your choice.

102
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:33,900
I'm going to name this vue-first-app

103
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,600
with dashes between the words.

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,910
But the name is up to you.

105
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,263
It should be a name without any white space though.

106
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:42,650
So it should be one word in the end

107
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,570
where you can separate words with dashes

108
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,403
if you want to.

109
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,690
Hit Enter thereafter

110
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,200
and you will be prompted a couple of questions.

111
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,510
Now, the exact look of this menu might change

112
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,180
but here, I'm currently asked

113
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,730
whether I wanna use the default settings

114
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,090
for Vue 2,

115
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,640
the default settings for Vue 3.

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Now, most likely, Vue 3 will be the first choice

117
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,380
in the future.

118
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,210
I'm recording this at a point of time

119
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,000
where Vue 3 is not fully final yet.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,680
It is not really released yet,

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,490
hence for me it's just the second option here.

122
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,410
Or you can manually select features you wanna have

123
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,653
in your new project.

124
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,260
Now, I'm going to go with that.

125
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,100
And now here, you've got various features,

126
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,400
which you can configure into your project.

127
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,360
Now, if you don't know what all these things are,

128
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,620
you can really just go with the default,

129
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,652
otherwise you can add them as needed.

130
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:37,140
There are a couple of features in here,

131
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,070
like Router and Vuex,

132
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,370
which we'll learn about throughout this course.

133
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,120
So for the moment, we can really go with the defaults here

134
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,490
and simply hit Enter to confirm them.

135
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,360
Choose the Vue version if you're prompted for it.

136
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,300
I'll go with 3.x, which this course is about.

137
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,900
The latest version of Vue.

138
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,340
And you should choose that as well if you're prompted.

139
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,963
And here, with the ESLint settings,

140
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,610
I'll go with that ESLint

141
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,603
with error prevention only strategy.

142
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,280
Confirm the default here as well

143
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,800
if you're asked for it.

144
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,760
And you can go with the first options here

145
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,470
in this last question as well.

146
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,270
Again, the exact options might differ

147
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,420
but the process should always be close

148
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,803
to what you're seeing here.

149
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,540
Now, we could save our picked settings here

150
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,510
as a default or as a preset for future projects

151
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,650
but I'm going to pick no here.

152
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,670
And not save it as a preset.

153
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,360
And now, this will create a new folder

154
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,450
with the name we chose initially

155
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,580
with the Vue project inside of it

156
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,740
but now with a Vue project

157
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,330
that has certain extra features

158
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,683
to make our life as a Vue developer easier.

159
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,900
No worries though,

160
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
you'll still write Vue code

161
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,430
as you learned it over the last modules.

162
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,250
It'll just be a nicer experience.

163
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,183
So let's wait for the Vue project generation to finish.

164
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,110
And once this does finish,

165
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,990
you see two commands here,

166
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,210
which you can execute

167
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,500
in order to see your generated Vue app in action

168
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,650
because you get a little dummy app

169
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,830
in that newly created folder.

170
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,890
So we can, first of all, cd.

171
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,800
So navigate into this newly created folder

172
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,320
and then run npm run serve,

173
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,650
which executes a predefined script

174
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,520
to basically spin up such a testing web development server

175
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,850
I was talking about,

176
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,180
which will then host this default dummy app we got here.

177
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,880
And you can view that app in your browser

178
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,570
under this address now,

179
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,030
which now uses the HTTP

180
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,863
instead of the file protocol,

181
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,460
which, as mentioned in an earlier lecture,

182
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,760
is exactly what we want.

183
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,210
So let's copy that address

184
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,890
and enter this in the browser

185
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,920
and you should see something like this.

186
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Now, the exact screen you're seeing here

187
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,990
might change over time.

188
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,440
This doesn't matter too much

189
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,480
because we're going to write our own app anyways.

190
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,320
But you should see something on the screen,

191
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,260
which proves that your development server

192
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,410
is up and running

193
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,170
and that some Vue project was generated.

194
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,100
Now let's explore what was generated,

195
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,550
which features we have available here

196
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,593
and which extra settings and tweaks we might need to do.
