1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,870
Now, before we dig deeper into components

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,810
and we learn more about this amazing

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,850
and very important feature,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,160
we need to change how we write our code.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,890
I mean, not the language or anything like that,

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,960
but our setup, because it turns out that this setup,

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,860
which we're currently using of having one JavaScript file,

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,210
which we import here into one HTML file,

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,980
which we simply opened by double-clicking on it,

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,240
and where we have to reload the page

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,770
whenever we wanna see a change,

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,780
that setup will not really scale well.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,910
We'll have problems with that setup

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,200
if we start building bigger, more realistic applications,

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,130
and therefore, in this module,

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,060
we're going to dive into a better development setup

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,060
with the Vue CLI, so with an extra tool we can use

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,650
to basically give us a better project setup,

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,880
which in the end will help us write Vue apps,

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,210
build Vue apps at scale, so build bigger Vue apps

21
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,900
and simply have a better time building Vue apps.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,480
Now, for that in this module,

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,010
you will of course learn what exactly the Vue CLI is,

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,230
and even more important than that,

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,690
why we need that extra tool,

26
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,270
why specifically we need that better setup,

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,740
and of course, I'll show you how to use that Vue CLI tool

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,540
and how to create better project setups,

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,133
and then, work with them.
