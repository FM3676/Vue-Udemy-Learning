1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,059
Let's come back to the example

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,860
you saw earlier in the course about this list of contacts.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,560
I mean, that is how we got started with components.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,090
So that's where I want to pick up.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,130
For that, here in the source folder, I will first of all,

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,060
create a brand new file and I will name it App.vue.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,370
You don't have to name it App,

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,350
but it is a convention to name your main file,

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,350
which holds your main vue app configuration, App.vue.

10
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:36,160
.vue is the extension which I'll use

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,950
so that I can use these signal file component features

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,980
in that file.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,670
Having a separate template, script and styling section,

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,750
I like that a lot.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,600
It helps me split that logic

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,470
and yet have it all in one place.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,440
And therefore, we will work with such vue files

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,670
a lot throughout this course and in any Vue application

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,360
you are going to build.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,460
So App.vue it is.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,480
And now in here, we can create two of these three sections

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,050
you saw before.

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,530
Create a template tag, opening and closing, like this

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,840
and create a script tag, opening and closing.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,040
We don't need a style tag for the moment.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,493
We'll add it later.

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,680
Now I will emphasize, again,

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,320
this is not code that would normally work.

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,340
It's also not a JavaScript file.

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,060
It's a DoD vue file.

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,740
So only does vue project set up knows how to handle it.

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,550
And behind the scenes Vue will basically transform this all

33
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,980
to just regular JavaScript code,

34
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,260
which the browser will understand.

35
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,990
But we're going to use this setup

36
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,583
since for us as a developer, that will make life easier.

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,330
And now in these script tags,

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,030
we provide the configuration for our Vue app here.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,160
For the app, we wanna mount to this div here

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,063
in the index HTML file.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,080
So therefore we create a standard JavaScript object here,

42
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,130
and we can also store this in a constant named app

43
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,002
if we want to.

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,930
And in here, we can now add what we learned about.

45
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,930
We can add data, we can add methods, we can add computed.

46
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,593
We can add whatever we need in this Vue app.

47
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,680
Now for the moment, I don't need methods and computed,

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,930
but here in my main app,

49
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,670
I wanna add some data.

50
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,980
And therefore, we'll return our object here,

51
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,250
as we learned it.

52
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,590
And in there have my friends, right?

53
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,950
Because that is what we had

54
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,570
in the component intro module as well.

55
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,260
And there we had two friend elements

56
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,410
where every element was just an object with an ID.

57
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,610
For example, we had Manuel here with a name,

58
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,000
which again, could be Manuel Lorenz or whichever friend name

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,770
you want to add, with a phone number

60
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,770
where I just going to a random phone number here

61
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,500
and an email where I will also just enter

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,490
a fictional email address.

63
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,040
And then we can duplicate this to also have a second friend.

64
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,430
And I used Julie before.

65
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,530
So I'm going to repeat that name,

66
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,293
Julie Jones, also with a random phone number here.

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,100
And again, this is all really up to you.

68
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,933
And here I have julie@localhost.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,190
So now we got data in our app config object here.

70
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,530
And if we leave aside how we use this object,

71
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,900
because currently we're not using it at all,

72
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,980
except for storing it in this constant.

73
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,310
If we leave that aside, it's just what we learned, right?

74
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,000
We have an object with a data method

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,930
where we return the data object.

76
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,643
So that's all what we learned before as well.

77
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,020
Now this should be the config object for our main app here.

78
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,940
How do we now get this config object in the App.vue file

79
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,903
into our create app method in main JS?

80
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,029
Well, we're going to use this import syntax here,

81
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,959
which you already see here.

82
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,600
This is a modern JavaScript feature,

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,720
which we use in Vue CLI created Vue projects

84
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,810
to combine different JavaScript files

85
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,810
and export a feature in one file

86
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,913
and use it in another.

87
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,110
For that, we import something from,

88
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,270
and then you point at the file from what you want to import.

89
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,150
And here you should use a relative import

90
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,200
starting with ./,

91
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,680
which means it's in the same folder as this file,

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,720
and then the file name.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,053
In this case, App.vue.

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,750
The import here looks a bit different.

95
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,860
It's not ./vue here

96
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,610
because here we're importing from a package

97
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,610
from this Vue package.

98
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,540
And if you're importing from a package,

99
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,630
you just reference the package name.

100
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,750
But if you're importing from a custom file,

101
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,983
like App.vue, you specify the path to that file.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,640
Now that ... is not the valid syntax though.

103
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,530
Instead, we could import a named export

104
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,530
by using curly braces or a default export.

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
Now you might not know what the difference is.

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,630
Here, we're going to use a default export

107
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,960
by just coming up with any name of our choice here

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
and importing that from that file.

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,080
And this identifier here is really up to you.

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,360
It could be hello.

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,410
It could be something.

112
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,000
But typically you name it just like the file was named

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,160
because in there we have our main app configuration.

114
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,890
So I'm going to name it App here as well.

115
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,580
And this is now what we pass to create app,

116
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,270
because App, what we import here

117
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,140
should just be this JavaScript object,

118
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,060
this Vue config JavaScript object.

119
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,100
However, at the moment, we're not exporting this here.

120
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,990
To export it, we should rather not store it in a constant,

121
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,700
which would only be available in this file

122
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,420
and not in any other file, but instead we use a syntax,

123
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,070
which is also default modern JavaScript.

124
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,070
Export, the export keyword and then the default keyword.

125
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,060
And this tells JavaScript that this object here

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,233
is the default export of this App.vue file.

127
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,140
And that means that whenever we import like this,

128
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,280
we're going to import that default.

129
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,260
So we're going to import that object.

130
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,860
So we're sharing this object from the App.vue file

131
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,640
to the main JS file.

132
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,860
And therefore, in the end,

133
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,860
we passed this config object to create App here.

134
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,140
And we're splitting this in multiple files

135
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,160
just to organize our code

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
and to make every file focused on a certain task

137
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
and therefore, the overall project, more readable,

138
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,920
which will really shine if you're building bigger,

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,523
more complex projects.

140
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,170
So now, long story short, we got our app config object here.

141
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,830
Now you'll notice one thing.

142
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,740
This Vue app, which we create here in the end

143
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,640
has no template.

144
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,080
We mount it to the div with ID app,

145
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,050
but this is an empty div.

146
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,560
Now, if we would have something in there like h2 tag,

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,340
we could, for example, use Vue features in there.

148
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,940
That's what you learned.

149
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,160
But in Vue CLI created projects like this,

150
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,280
this is typically not what you do.

151
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,300
You'll leave that index HTML file alone.

152
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,340
Instead, that is what we have this template section for

153
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,740
in a .vue file.

154
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Here, we can now define the template of this Vue app.

155
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,890
So here we could now add h2, tag,

156
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,193
and say, my friends.

157
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,410
And then below that, for example, add an unordered list

158
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,410
where we wanna output all those friends here like this.

159
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,660
And we could also wrap this all into a section

160
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,973
if we wanted to.

161
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,220
So we can write our HTML code for this script here.

162
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,393
And this is just regular HTML markup.

163
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,720
Now, if we saved that all and we go back to the page,

164
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,210
local host 80:80 with the development server up and running,

165
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,490
this page automatically updated without you reloading it

166
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,340
to show our app content.

167
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,260
So to show this parsed and rendered template,

168
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,580
which we defined for our main app.

169
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,810
And that's how we work with those .vue files

170
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,343
and with a project set up like this.

171
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,200
Now this has nothing to do with components thus far.

172
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,100
That's just a different way of creating our Vue app.

173
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,410
But it's important to understand this

174
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,960
because we will create components basically in the same way.

175
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,240
So let's do that as a next step.

176
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
Let's add our first component in the setup

177
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,653
before we then really dive into component communication.
