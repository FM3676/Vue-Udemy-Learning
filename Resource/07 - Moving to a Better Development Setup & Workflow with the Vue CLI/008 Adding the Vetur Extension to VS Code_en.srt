1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,600
Thus far, we're using Visual Studio Code

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,880
in a fairly simple and trivial configuration.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,790
Now, it's time to install one extra extension

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,690
that will help us with Vue development.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,950
For that go to view extensions in Visual Studio Code

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,023
and their search for vetur.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,990
This is an extension which you should install

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,840
into your Visual Studio Code.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,370
I already got it installed,

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,690
but I will need to enable it.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,670
And once you installed it,

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,480
you will see that in those .vue files,

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,790
you now do get highlighting.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,730
You now do have an IDE that understands those files.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,590
And with that I can go to the explorer view here.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,210
And now, vetur is an extension

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,980
that does not just make Visual Studio Code

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,890
understand .vue files,

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,310
but which will help you with Vue development in general.

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,310
So, vetur is a must have extension for Vue developers.

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,340
It will help you with auto completion.

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,920
It will ensure that you have a better development experience

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,203
just by installing that extension.
