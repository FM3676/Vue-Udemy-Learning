1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,550
So now I opened this generated folder,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,220
which we generated with the vue create command,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,550
the vue-first app folder, in my case.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,990
I opened it with Visual Studio Code

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,329
with the editor we've been using thus far,

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,240
simply with file open,

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,293
and then by picking that whole folder which was created.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,410
Now in that folder, you see a bunch of files,

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,633
and also sub folders.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,860
In my case, I got a node modules sub folder,

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,240
a public sub folder,

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,940
and a source sub folder.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,420
And then well, a bunch of files.

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,300
And that's the project set up

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,053
the vue CLI generated for us here.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,530
Now, let me quickly walk you

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,940
through the structure we have here.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,030
On the root level of this project folder.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,780
We have a bunch of configuration files.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,050
You don't need to care too much about them.

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,920
Unless you know what you're doing,

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,650
you can leave all the defaults there.

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,210
The package.json file is interesting.

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,260
This in the end defines the

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,580
scripts we can execute like NPM run serve,

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,303
which we started to start the development server.

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,350
And under the hood, you can see those scripts

28
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,870
all seem to use something from the vue CLI,

29
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,053
so they're doing stuff that has been pre configured for us.

30
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,110
We also have dependencies here.

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,270
And there for example, you see vue,

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,880
the framework as a dependency.

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,720
These are packages which are now available in our code.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,790
And package simply means that this will be imported

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,290
and added to our code automatically.

36
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,000
We don't need to add any script tags in any HTML file

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,760
to have those packages available.

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,460
Throughout this course, we're going to add more packages.

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,710
But for now, we can start with these

40
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,880
packages which we have here.

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,770
We also got certain development dependencies.

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,700
These are also packages,

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,410
but only packages which our project set up here

44
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,770
uses under the hood,

45
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,270
for example, the development server

46
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,763
is in one of those packages.

47
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,520
So these are all packages,

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,220
which we don't have to care about.

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,460
These are packages, which we're going to use

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,823
actively or implicitly when we write code.

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,550
Now that's it for this file.

52
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,810
We can ignore all the other files for now,

53
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,520
and instead have a look at the other folders.

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,100
Node modules in the end houses

55
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,850
the packages mentioned in package.json.

56
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,500
Here we specify that we need them, NPM,

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,410
the node package manager tool

58
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,590
which we installed together with node,

59
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,560
then in the end

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,140
goes ahead and downloads those packages into our project

61
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,953
and stores them in the node modules folder.

62
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,010
It does that with a specific command you can run

63
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,100
in the terminal,

64
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,260
if we quit that running development server,

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,350
which you can do with Ctrl+C,

66
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,130
you can run NPM install

67
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,220
to tell NPM to have a look at package.json,

68
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,200
download all those dependencies into a node modules folder.

69
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,300
And well, then they're available.

70
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,990
And once that NPM install process finished,

71
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,550
which you don't need to do right now,

72
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,690
because the vue CLI did it for us

73
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,360
when it created the project.

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,530
Once that finished,

75
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,300
you can again run NPM run serve

76
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,400
to bring up that development server again.

77
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,133
And by the way,

78
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,260
you should keep that server up and running,

79
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,700
you should keep that process up and running.

80
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,420
Because you can only test your app

81
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,480
as long as that is running.

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,710
If you're done for the day,

83
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,980
you can quit with Ctrl+C.

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,830
But if you're starting to write code again in that project,

85
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,610
you need to run that server again.

86
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,160
That's an important note here about that server

87
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,380
that it should be up and running whilst you're writing code.

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,170
NPM install is required

89
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,470
whenever you share a project

90
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,090
without node modules for example,

91
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,830
like the future code attachments

92
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,470
you will find in this course,

93
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,120
then you need to run NPM install

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,650
once to make sure that all the packages are available

95
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,840
in a brand new project created with vue create,

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,830
you don't need to run NPM install

97
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,830
because vue create, the command we executed

98
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,720
to create a project already did that for us.

99
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,853
And that's the node modules folder.

100
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,410
Lot of talking about that,

101
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,769
but it is important to understand what it does.

102
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,670
It contains our dependencies,

103
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,470
for example, the vue framework,

104
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,180
and also dependencies of dependencies.

105
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,883
That's why it's so big.

106
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,300
You should leave the node modules folder alone,

107
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,060
don't change code in there,

108
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,340
don't delete it,

109
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,850
that will all impact your application in a negative way.

110
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,463
You should just leave it here.

111
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,870
The public folder is a very simple folder.

112
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,810
Here in the end, we got a HTML file.

113
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,590
And this is a very simple looking file

114
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,630
that's in the end the file,

115
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,980
that will contain our vue application in the end.

116
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,550
You see it has a div with ID app

117
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,360
and in the end you will soon see that is

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,323
where our vue app will be mounted to.

119
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,020
And we will only have one HTML file here,

120
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,570
since we're building a vue single-page application,

121
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,030
which means everything we see on the screen

122
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,070
will be controlled with vue and JavaScript.

123
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,680
And we'll just have one HTML file

124
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,363
and use vue to bring different things onto the screen.

125
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,640
Now all the imports that might be needed here,

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,810
and all of that will be managed automatically,

127
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,120
by the vue CLI and by that development server,

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,000
so we don't need to edit this HTML file right now.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,890
Instead, we have that source folder here.

130
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,640
And that source folder contains the JavaScript code

131
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,470
we are going to write

132
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,600
so it contains our vue code in the end,

133
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,340
and it is worth a closer look.

134
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,720
Because you can already tell

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,050
there are some strange files in here,

136
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,650
for example, a .vue file.

137
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,033
Now what's that about?
