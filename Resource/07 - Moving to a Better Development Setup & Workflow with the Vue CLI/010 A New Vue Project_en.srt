1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,550
For this, I got a brand new project for you.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,400
You'll find it attached to this lecture, simply download it,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,400
extract the folder and store that folder

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,830
anywhere on your system, as you did at many times before.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,320
And you'll notice one important thing.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,100
This is a project which I created for you

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,070
with the Vue CLI.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,770
So therefore here, you don't need to create it on your own.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,790
You can just use this attached one.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,950
It is a project which I created with Vue create though.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,010
I'm attaching it,

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,490
so that we're all using the same project set up.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,920
Now in here, you'll notice something interesting.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,300
The source folder is pretty empty.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,900
There's just a main JS file in there

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,370
with not a lot of content.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,350
So therefore here I got no view code,

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,560
no view app and no view components in there.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,510
And I'm doing this on purpose so that we can get started

20
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,850
with that together and you will learn step by step,

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,400
how to write Vue code and how to add Vue components

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,090
in a brand new Vue project like this one.

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,160
Besides that, we got the public folder

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,080
with the index HTML file,

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,793
which I already explained in the last module.

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,950
Now to get started writing code,

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,430
there are two things which we need to do first.

28
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,340
The first one is that we install all the dependencies

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,500
of this project.

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,200
So the dependencies mentioned in the package dot Json file.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,670
These dependencies and also D development dependencies.

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,140
Because the attached folder D attached sip file

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,830
has no node modules folder.

34
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,800
Not because I forgot it,

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,020
but because it's super big and the sip file

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,830
would be multiple hundred megabytes big,

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,780
if I would have added it.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,530
That's too big and there is no needs to add it

39
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,420
because all you need to do is run NPM install

40
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,430
inside of the project folder.

41
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,170
And here's the easiest way of doing that,

42
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,760
in visual studio code,

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,520
in which you should open this attached folder.

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,122
Go to terminal, New terminal.

45
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,770
And this will open up your default system terminal,

46
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,170
your default system command prompt here

47
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,330
as part of visual studio code.

48
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,810
The advantage is that you don't have to switch

49
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,450
to a different screen and even better,

50
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,010
that you're already navigated into this folder.

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,550
So you don't need to use the CD command

52
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,050
to navigate somewhere else.

53
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,420
Instead, this terminal already is navigated

54
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,880
into this project folder.

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,840
And therefore in this terminal,

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,380
you should now run NPM install

57
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,550
to install all the dependencies of this project.

58
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,080
And whenever you're downloading one of my code snapshots,

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,090
which you will find throughout the course,

60
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,760
you should also run this command If you want to run my code.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,500
Because all code snapshots attached to any lecture

62
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,853
will be missing the node modules folder.

63
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,220
So hit Enter,

64
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,740
and this will now download all the required dependencies

65
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,860
and also the dependencies off dependencies.

66
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,110
And it will generate these node modules folder,

67
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,860
and store all the dependencies in there.

68
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,383
So let's wait for this process to finish.

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,270
And once it is finished we got the node modules folder,

70
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,580
and we're now ready to get started

71
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,493
running our development server.

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,333
By the way,

73
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,700
you can ignore that this file changed the color here.

74
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,940
That's just because I'm using Git,

75
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,360
a version control system as well,

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,480
but you don't need to use that.

77
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,630
So you can ignore that.

78
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,220
So as a next step, let's now run NPM run serve.

79
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,850
This will start this development script,

80
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,910
which spins up D development server.

81
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,910
And I'm doing this in the same terminal,

82
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,270
which I used for running NPM install.

83
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,940
So did I do it in this project folder,

84
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,520
which is where you should run this command.

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,620
And now we got that development server up and running

86
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,160
and we should keep it up and running as mentioned before,

87
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,260
as long as we're writing code.

88
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,950
This ensures that any changes will be picked up

89
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,500
and we can see them on the serve page.

90
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,020
And the serve page will even reload automatically

91
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,340
whenever we do change anything.

92
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,240
So therefore we'll keep this up and running

93
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,740
and it'll just shrink it a bit

94
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,520
so that it doesn't take up as much space.

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,153
But I will still have it around.

96
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,770
Now we can visit local host, 8080.

97
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,530
And that's our running Vue application.

98
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,680
And as you can clearly see, initially it's empty.

99
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,440
There's nothing here.

100
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,560
And the reason for that simply is that,

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,910
well, we don't have anything here.

102
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,410
We just got this main JS file,

103
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,890
which creates an empty view app without any configuration.

104
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,230
Well, now that we got all set up,

105
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,010
let's dive into writing some component code

106
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,453
and let's learn more about components.
