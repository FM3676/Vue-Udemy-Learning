1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,380
Before we start using the Vue CLI

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,109
before we start creating those better project setups,

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,600
which I talked about.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,170
Let's understand why exactly

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,050
we might need such better setups.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,110
Now here's one thing which we will, for example need,

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,170
a proper development web server.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,810
Now, what do I mean by that?

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,040
Currently we're testing our Vue application

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,930
by double clicking the index HTML file,

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,200
and then seeing it in the browser.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,930
This works, but it's actually unrealistic.

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,930
It's actually not how we wanna test this, why?

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,530
Because with that,

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,200
we actually use the file protocol

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,200
instead of the HTTPS protocol, you can see this here.

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,590
This is loaded as a file in the browser.

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,103
Now, if a load, a page like google.com,

19
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:58,470
this is not loaded as a file, instead here,

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,180
this is loaded as a website using the HTTP

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,830
or actually the HTTPS protocol.

22
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,510
And that is a totally different thing that influences how

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,610
the pages served and also which features

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,800
are available in our code.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,400
So which features we can use in our Java script code

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,830
and with that file protocol thus far, everything worked,

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,710
but that wouldn't stay that way

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,300
because indeed certain modern JavaScript features

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,570
would not really work in that file protocol set up.

30
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,100
And in addition, there's one important thing you have

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,650
to keep in mind the users of your website,

32
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,290
of your Vue web app.

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,380
So the users you wanna target with your app,

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,670
they will in the end wizard a website, right?

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,870
You're building a website which eventually

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,270
will be hosted on some server.

37
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,380
So therefore the final app,

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,600
which your users see will be hosted by a server

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,090
and therefore will be served via HTTPS,

40
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,700
not wired a file protocol

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,240
that filed protocol is only available locally

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,250
on your computer if you double click the HTML file,

43
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,400
that's not what will be used once the webpage is served

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,000
to your users by a server in the end,

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,960
and therefore you are doing something which is not really

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,350
good, you are testing your web application under different

47
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,200
circumstances then your users will see them in the end.

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,160
Now I can tell you thus far that wouldn't make a difference.

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
What you learned over the last modules

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,500
applies in exactly the same way

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,620
no matter how the HTML file is served,

52
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,150
but going forward,

53
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,640
we definitely wanna switch

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,270
to a more realistic development set up.

55
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,750
And we, for example,

56
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,300
definitely wanna have a development web server,

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,640
which is a web server running locally on your machine so

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,740
that you don't need to pay for any server right now,

59
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,050
you can still test everything locally on your machine,

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,680
but with an important difference,

61
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,640
this development web server,

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,630
which I will show you how to set up,

63
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,380
it will be very easy, no worries.

64
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,580
This development web server will serve your web app,

65
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,280
your HTML file, why are the HTTPS

66
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,630
or the HTTP protocol on your machine?

67
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,660
Not why are the file protocol.

68
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,143
And that will be one important difference.
