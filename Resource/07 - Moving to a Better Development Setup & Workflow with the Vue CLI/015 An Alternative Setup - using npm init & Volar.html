<p>The Vue ecosystem keeps on advancing and developing and therefore, there now are official alternatives to using the Vue CLI&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Vetur.</p><p>You CAN&nbsp;still use those tools (and in this course, these are the tools being used - so to follow along smoothly, you might want to use them as well).</p><p>But, alternatively and 100% optionally to using the Vue CLI and Vetur, you can also use two different tools /&nbsp;approaches:</p><p>1. Use <code>npm init vue</code> instead of installing and using the Vue CLI</p><p>2. Use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volar</a> extension instead of Vetur</p><p>You don't have to use either of the two, but you may want to experiment with them. The Vue code you write, is of course 100%&nbsp;the same as shown in this course - no matter which setup you're using.</p><p><code>npm init vue</code> uses an official package to help you initialize Vue projects. You get a command line wizard that walks you through project creation, comparable to what you get with the Vue CLI (though with slightly different choices and options). For a basic Vue project, you can select "No"&nbsp;for all options.</p>
