<p>In the next lecture, we will use a third-party tool (Vue CLI)&nbsp; to create a new project. This tool, under the hood, uses NodeJS - a software which you need to download as part of the next lecture.</p><p>You will learn about the details in the next lectures but make sure that you <strong>DON'T</strong> <strong>use NodeJS version 17 for the moment</strong>! Because at the moment, due to a bug, the created project won't work with that version.</p><p>Instead, download the LTS version of NodeJS. You can download that version via this link (use the "LTS" version): <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a></p>
