1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,010
So now that we got this extension installed,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,570
that we've got our project created,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,780
and a running development server,

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,460
let's see what else we got here in the source folder.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,910
We got this .vue file which maybe is still something

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,360
you need to get used to, but in the end,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,140
that's just a file that contains the configuration

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,170
for a Vue app or a component,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,310
and then, the template for that app or a component.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,710
So what we previously defined just in the DOM

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,340
in the HTML file or as a template string,

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,230
which was pretty unreadable,

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,090
what we defined like this before is now simply defined

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,320
in such a template tag in a .vue file,

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,283
in such a single-file component.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,950
You also got a assets folder with a little image,

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,880
that's in general where you would add images your app needs,

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,970
and a components folder holding another Vue component.

19
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,370
Now, the exact code you're seeing here

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,440
and also here might differ over time, by the way,

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,540
but you should have some component

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,370
in your components folder,

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,010
and that is indeed how we will write Vue apps

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,540
for the rest of the course.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,370
We'll split our code into components

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,060
and compose our user interface

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,453
and the entire Vue app by combining those components.

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,130
And I'd say that's already enough

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,720
of the talking about the setup.

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,840
We now understand why we have it and how it works.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,120
Let's now go back to components

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,520
and build up on such a Vue CLI-generated project

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,860
to dive deeper into components

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,993
and again, learn more about Vue.
