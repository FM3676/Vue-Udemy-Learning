1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,230
So, let's now work on the styling.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,140
Because, at the moment, this is quite ugly.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,280
There are different ways of adding styling.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,020
But, I will show you the way you will most commonly use,

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,150
and which is the recommended way.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,470
You might remember, that in our ".Vue" files,

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,620
we not only had a template and a script section,

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,310
but we could also add a style section.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,610
Now, adding it is optional.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,830
As you can clearly tell. It worked without it too.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,800
But, here you can define the style of your app,

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,300
or component.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,340
So, here I added the style section "App Vue"

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,580
And attached, you will find the styles CSS file.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,890
Which we used before, in the component introduction module.

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,510
You can simply download it

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,860
and then copy all the styles you find in there,

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,730
and add them here,

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,213
between these style tags.

20
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,080
Save your code, thereafter.

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,020
And if you now reload, you should have some styling back.

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,160
Still not the final styling. But better than nothing.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,133
Especially our components, don't look too bad.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,060
Now, to also improve your overall styling,

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,390
here in the App Vue template,

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,203
I'll wrap this h2 tag here, into a header.

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,663
Like this. And actually, also convert it to h1 tag.

28
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,060
And if we save that, this now looks better.

29
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,563
And now, we've got our styling back.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,900
Now, there is actually more you can do

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,620
with that styling here.

32
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,070
You can for example, later,

33
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,380
also lock it to a specific component,

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,050
to make sure that only that component receives the styling.

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,290
But, that's something we'll explore later.

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,073
For the moment, the styling added here will do the trick.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,330
And with that, we now have a nicer project setup.

38
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,010
Where we've got this realistic development server,

39
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,990
where the app automatically reloads,

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,660
whenever we save a change.

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,770
And where we also get better IDE support.

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,009
And in general, have a setup,

43
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,470
which will not only work for small apps,

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,323
but also for bigger apps.
