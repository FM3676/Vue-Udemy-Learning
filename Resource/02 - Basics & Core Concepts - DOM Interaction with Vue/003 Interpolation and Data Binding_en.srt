1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,291
To output data

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,870
in your Vue controlled HTML part,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,250
there is a special syntax,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,270
which is only available in HTML parts

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,270
that are controlled by Vue,

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,200
because what Vue will do behind the scenes

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,780
is it will scan this HTML code

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,760
you could say,

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,371
and detect certain features,

10
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:26,170
a certain syntax, which it supports.

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,770
And the syntax we're going to use here

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,180
for outputting text, for outputting content

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,479
in your template,

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,580
is this one.

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,270
Double curly braces, opening and closing.

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,940
By default, if you use that in HTML,

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,280
this will do nothing.

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,560
Well, actually you will simply see

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,660
that on the screen thereafter.

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,860
If you use the syntax in a Vue controlled HTML snippet,

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,940
it will do something special,

22
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,060
between those opening and closing double curly braces.

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,950
You can reference your returned data object properties,

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,400
like course Goal.

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,319
So, here we can write course Goal,

26
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,960
and Vue will make that connection,

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,170
will understand, that you wanna output

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,660
the content stored in course Goal here.

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,630
And it'll do just that.

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,700
So, if you save this HTML and JavaScript,

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,310
if both is saved and you reload your webpage,

32
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,420
you will see, finish the course and learn Vue here,

33
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,323
just like that.

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,030
And this is pretty amazing, even though of course,

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,640
it's a very simple app,

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,340
but keep in mind that this text is stored in JavaScript.

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,610
Yet, it's rendered on the screen,

38
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,200
thanks to Vue and this special syntax.

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,100
And this syntax here is called interpolation.

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,870
You don't need to remember this, but that's its name.

41
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,290
Interpolation, simply means that in here,

42
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,270
you can reference properties, that are part of that object,

43
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,900
you return in data,

44
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,340
and then the value of the property will be output

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,310
instead of this part.

46
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,050
And Vue automatically detect this

47
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,790
and do all that outputting part for you.

48
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,680
If you use this syntax.

49
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,530
And just to make this really clear,

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,130
if you would use this anywhere else,

51
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,420
let's say here in the header,

52
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,529
which is not Vue controlled,

53
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:19,720
you would just see this as text

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,450
and it would not be replaced

55
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,500
because that is really only a Vue feature.

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,670
This interpolation syntax.

57
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,190
And this interpolation syntax is key.

58
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,460
We're going to use it a lot, through out the course

59
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,330
because it's one of the key features of Vue,

60
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,760
which is why I'm getting started with it.

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,290
It's also worth noting,

62
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,950
that you cannot just output text like this,

63
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,700
but you could also output a number,

64
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,310
if I save that.

65
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,110
And you could also output something like true or false,

66
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,540
if you want it to.

67
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,980
Now if you have an array in there,

68
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,250
let's say, you can always output that as we see.

69
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,880
So, it's really flexible.

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,750
You can, for example,

71
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,993
also, I'll put an object like this.

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,090
So, it's really flexible regarding what you can do,

73
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,560
but here we want that string.

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,490
So I'm going to use that.

75
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,380
Now that's interpolation and the data property,

76
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,510
in the object you use for configuring your app,

77
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,390
your Vue app.

78
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,390
And this is the first very important takeaway

79
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,830
or the first two important takeaways.

80
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,240
These are two core features,

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,090
data and interpolation,

82
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,450
which we're going to use throughout the entire course

83
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,940
and which you will definitely use

84
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,963
in any Vue app you're building.
