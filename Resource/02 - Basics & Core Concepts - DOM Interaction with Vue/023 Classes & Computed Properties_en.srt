1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,730
Now you can also,

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,880
utilize Computed Properties here if you want.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,810
Because I mentioned having Logic in the HTML Code

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,490
is suboptimal.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,770
Now, for it as class binding, it actually is okay.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,440
But if you want to move this Logic here,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,310
out of the HTML Code.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,690
Well, you can simply add Computed Properties here

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,750
in your Vue Config Object by adding the Computed Key.

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,750
And in there any name of your choice, like, "Box A Classes,"

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,450
because here I wanna derive the classes

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,960
that should be added to box A

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,040
and then simply put this Logic.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,873
Ops.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,580
This Logic here,

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,860
which I'm binding to my first box in here

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,500
and return it here, return as object in box A classes,

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
and then bind class here to box A classes,

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,870
just like that.

20
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,570
If I reload,

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,843
it crashes because of course this now shouldn't be this box

22
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:08,700
I selected here since I'm now inside of my Vue app.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,200
But now if I reload,

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,090
this works just before with a Computed Property.

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,530
This can especially be helpful

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,910
if you have more complex dynamic class code,

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,620
if you're not just referring

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,830
to a true or false Boolean here,

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,030
but if you had a more complex check

30
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,080
or different if statements here

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,720
where you want to return different objects.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,510
In such cases as always Computed Properties

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,710
can shine a lot,

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,110
but you can also use it here

35
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,030
to simplify your HTML Code a bit more

36
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,010
and move that Logic into JavaScript.

37
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,220
It's optional here, though.

38
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,100
You can do it, but for a styling

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,300
for dynamic styling,

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,930
it's definitely not a must do,

41
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,470
unless you have very complex code

42
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,813
for finding out whether a class should be added or not.
