1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,500
So with interpolation and V-bind,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,530
we learned about two key features for outputting,

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,530
and for a using Vue-managed data in the HTML code.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,500
And that is really important.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,110
Now let's make our app at least a bit more dynamic.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,520
And for data, let's say we actually

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,440
have two possible courseGoals,

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,120
which we wanna output here.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,930
And for the moment, we'll randomly decide

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,920
which one to output.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,760
Now for that, we need to run some code.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
We need to basically roll a dice you could say,

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,440
and then either use this text

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,040
or another text as a courseGoal.

15
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:42,440
And we can do this with another option.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,870
We can set on this Vue app object.

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,400
We already set the data option.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,360
Now it's time to learn about a new option.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,390
And that's the methods option.

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,640
Methods allows you to define functions

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,770
which should execute when something happens

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,819
when you call them for example, or as you will learn later,

23
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,140
when a user event like a button click occurs.

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,490
Two methods you pass a JavaScript object.

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,840
So that's important difference to data.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,260
Data itself was a function a method,

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,260
methods takes an object, which will be full of methods,

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,000
so of functions, but these functions

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,100
are now totally up to you.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,070
You can name them however you want.

31
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,070
For example, outputGoal, but this is totally up to you.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,060
This can be any name you want.

33
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,640
methods on the other hand,

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,130
just like data is a reserved term, is a reserved name.

35
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,120
But inside of this methods object,

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,610
you can use whatever you want.

37
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,560
The only important thing here is,

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,990
that all your properties you defined in this methods object

39
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,560
needs to be functions

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,650
because they need to be callable as functions.

41
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,950
And you can either do it like this

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,740
or use the method shorthand in here.

43
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,653
Just as we did with data.

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,730
Now, in outputGoal, we could now calculate

45
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,470
a randomNumber with math random,

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,710
which is a built in function in JavaScript.

47
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,170
totally unrelated to Vue, it's a core JavaScript function.

48
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,410
And it will simply calculate a randomNumber

49
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,813
between zero and one.

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,660
And here, we could then simply add an if check

51
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,390
and say if randomNumber is smaller than zero dot five.

52
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,113
We wanna return learn Vue, as a goal.

53
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,660
And else, return master Vue whatever you want,

54
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,253
those strings are up to you.

55
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,750
And now we got this function, this method outputGoal,

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,330
which will either return this or this text.

57
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,800
Now we wanna use this text here in this paragraph

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,640
to well, display a different text every time

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,300
this page is reloaded.

60
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,120
So for that, we to call this function somehow,

61
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,693
so that it executes.

62
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,280
And the cool thing is we can call a method,

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,970
so a function defined in this methods object

64
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,740
in our HTML code,

65
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,270
just as we can point at a data property, you can do both.

66
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,790
So here right now we're pointing at a data property.

67
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,180
But we can also instead if we want

68
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,920
to execute a function that is defined in methods,

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,280
that's just important, it needs to be defined and methods.

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,390
So adding outputGoal here,

71
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,820
directly in that config object you pass to create app

72
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,913
would not work, for example.

73
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,540
But since outputGoal is defined in methods,

74
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,830
we can call it here.

75
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,490
And since we wanna call it, we need to add parentheses here,

76
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,130
just like in regular JavaScript.

77
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,390
And that's the interesting part, by the way,

78
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,590
in your Vue controlled HTML code

79
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,600
in this interpolation syntax,

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,410
but also when using display binding syntax,

81
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,040
you can execute simple JavaScript code.

82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,150
For example, here, we could also execute

83
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,853
one plus one if we wanted to.

84
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,710
We could also execute math random here, if you want a to.

85
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,810
What you can't do in here is write complex code.

86
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,070
For example, you can't use if statements in here,

87
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,390
this will not work.

88
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,590
But you can use ternary expressions,

89
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,110
and you can write any JavaScript expression

90
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,960
between your double curly braces and when using v-bind.

91
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,920
And therefore since we can use

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,390
such basic JavaScript expressions,

93
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,313
we can also call outputGoal here like this.

94
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,710
And if I save that and reload,

95
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,370
I see learn Vue.

96
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,680
If I reload, at some point, I'll see master Vue

97
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,480
I'll see a different value from time to time

98
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,600
because we always calculate a brand new value

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,610
because this gets called.

100
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,250
And I'm showing this to you because it is important

101
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,690
to understand how Vue works

102
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,760
that you can execute JavaScript expressions here

103
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,030
between the curly braces and when using v-bind.

104
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,830
And that this gives you a lot of flexibility.

105
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,180
Because just by using this very simple example,

106
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,850
our application here is at least a bit more dynamic,

107
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,260
because now we don't always see the same text here.

108
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,460
Instead, after some reloads, it changes.

109
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,710
And that is a more dynamic application,

110
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,530
which we can easily build with Vue,

111
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,150
and which we couldn't build

112
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,620
with just HTML without JavaScript.

113
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,780
So with that, we're already getting closer to seeing

114
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,190
why Vue is really amazing,

115
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,790
and we built our first

116
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,603
at least a bit more dynamic application.
