1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,939
There's one more syntax supported by Vue

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,060
which I don't want to hide from you.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,290
You can have multiple class attributes like this,

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,340
but if you have multiple class assignments,

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,720
you can also just work with one dynamic class assignment

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,780
where you, for example, have this object syntax,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,160
but not passing the object like this,

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,490
but instead pass an array where your object,

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,070
where you configure which class should be added,

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,880
could be one element in the array.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,510
And other elements could be, for example, demo as a string.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,120
So with that, you can also add

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,050
multiple potentially dynamically derived classes

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,100
to one at the same div by using this array syntax,

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,880
which also works just fine.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,710
That's just a number of syntax to be aware of.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,620
You have multiple options here,

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,660
and it of course depends on your personal preferences

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,510
and also on what you're building,

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,280
which option you want to go with,

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,030
but that is dynamic styling

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,890
and what you can do regarding that in Vue.

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,890
Obviously super powerful and super important

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,960
as you will all see throughout this course

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,180
and the different projects we're going to build

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,120
because with dynamic styling,

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,033
you can really build amazing user interfaces.
