00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:03,120
I know that there's,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,330
Methods vs Computed vs Watchers thing.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,000
Can be very confusing.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
So it's time for a short summary.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,070
Methods can be used in your template to bind data,

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,800
to use them in a interpolation, for example.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,400
To derive data that should be used in the template

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,120
or for event binding.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,290
You can use methods for both.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,120
And if you use them in the data binding use case,

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,820
so if you use them between curly braces, for example,

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,720
to outsource logic from the template to your view instance,

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,360
then the method is executed

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,500
for every re-render cycle of the component.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,110
So whenever something changes

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,020
and the template is re-evaluated,

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,170
every method that's called in the template

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,400
will be called again.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,800
That's what I showed you a couple of lectures ago.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,910
And therefore,

21
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,010
you should use methods primarily for event binding.

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,620
There it's a no brainer.

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,970
You always use them

24
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,200
or for data binding,

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,840
so with double curly braces, for example,

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,570
if you really want them to re-execute

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,961
whenever something changes on the page.

28
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:08,060
Otherwise, you use computed properties

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,470
because those can only be used with data binding.

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,700
You don't use them with event binding.

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,710
And computed properties are great to derive data

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,920
that's based on other data with the advantage

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,790
that they will only be re-evaluated and re-executed by view

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,140
if the dependent data changed.

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,630
So if the data used inside of the computed property changed,

36
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,350
they will not be re-evaluated if some other data changed.

37
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,350
And therefore, use them for data that depends on other data.

38
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,920
Last but not least,

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,060
Watchers are not directly used in the template.

40
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,870
You don't reference them there,

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,140
but you can watch any property,

42
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,670
even computed properties with them.

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,630
And that allows you to run code

44
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,630
in reaction to some change data.

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,050
For example, to send the HTTP request,

46
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,820
set a timer, stores something in local storage,

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,070
whatever it is.

48
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,780
So typically, you should use Watchers

49
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,550
for any non data updates you wanna make.

50
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,180
Whatever you got some behind the scenes work to do

51
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,039
based on some changing data,

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,380
you might wanna consider a Watcher.

53
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,080
Amongst the free Watchers

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,820
are probably the feature you'll use the least

55
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,860
because you need methods all the time with event binding

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,540
and computed properties for outputting data

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,953
that depends on other data.
