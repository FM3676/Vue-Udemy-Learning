00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,410
Now to conclude this introduction to events,

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,330
which is another core feature, as you can clearly tell,

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,950
let me show you one other directive

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,720
which you will very rarely need, but which sometimes

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,593
in niche scenarios could be helpful.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,040
Let's say for whatever reason, here in this app,

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,960
we want to make sure that when we change the counter here,

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,711
the output here doesn't change, so that the initial value

9
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,660
of the counter is preserved here.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,440
Now, you might wonder why we might want to do that.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Let's say we have a number of paragraph,

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,180
where we simply output the starting counter value.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,670
And we wanna point at the counter property

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,160
we're managing in our Vue instance, so that,

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,460
if we ever change it here,

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,820
we do reflect that correct starting counter here.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,930
But we want to make sure that

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,680
the starting counter never changes.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,670
And right now of course, since we reference counter,

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,203
it will change whenever we change to counter.

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,800
If you have such a scenario that you have some data

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,930
that changes and you want to preserve the initial state

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,350
and not reflect any other changes,

24
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,490
there is a special directive you can put on to the element

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,760
where you are using that dynamic value in.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,760
And that's the V once directive which is built into Vue.

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,680
This tells Vue that any dynamic data bindings,

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,653
like this interpolation here on this element,

29
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:35,920
should only be evaluated once.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,390
So if data value changes thereafter, here in this place,

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,510
it will not be reflected it will not be updated.

32
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,600
So now if I reload, we see the starting counter 10 here,

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
but if I change the counter, it only changes down there

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,793
in the second green box and not in the first one.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,480
Now again, this is a niche feature, but it is useful

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,760
to be aware of it if you ever had a scenario like this

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,450
where you need to lock an initial value in,

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,957
we once can help you with that.
