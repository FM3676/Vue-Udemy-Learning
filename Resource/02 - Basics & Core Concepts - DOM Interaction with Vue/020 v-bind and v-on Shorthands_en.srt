1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,350
So now, it's almost time to practice again,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,350
but here's what important shorthand,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,390
one way of writing a bit shorter code

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,980
which you should be aware of.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,270
Not directly related to computed properties and watchers,

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,470
but to view in general.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,780
We used v-on quite a bit

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,390
and before we also used v-bind, if you remember.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,490
Now, v-on and v-bind are so common

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,780
that there are shorthands for them.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,980
Instead of using v-on:click, v-on:click,

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,680
v-on:input and whatever you want to do.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,830
You can replace v-on colon, with an at symbol.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,580
And that's exactly the same thing.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,960
It's just a shorthand provided by view

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,653
to make adding event listeners a bit easier.

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,320
You can still combine this with modifiers

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,820
and still do everything you did before,

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,660
you just replace v-on colon with @,

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,290
so that you have less code to write.

21
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,630
It's up to you if you want to use that,

22
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,720
you just should be consistent.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,230
So if you do use it, use it for all events, not just some.

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,520
And I'm going to use it throughout the course, by the way.

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,993
But you don't have to, it's just an alternative.

26
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,950
We also have a shortcut for v-bind.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,730
If we had v-bind:value here,

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,100
then we can actually also just omit v-bind

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,430
and just have colon value

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,230
for binding an attribute dynamically.

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,780
So just colon, attribute name

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,230
is a shorthand for v-bind colon attribute name

33
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,230
and @event name is a shortcut for a v-on colon event name.

34
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,780
Again, it's up to you, what you prefer,

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,310
but you should be consistent

36
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,600
and I'm going to use these shorthands throughout the course.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,103
There is no v-model shorthand, by the way.
