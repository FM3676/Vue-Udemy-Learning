1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,040
So, now before we dive

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,550
into our first practice

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,970
of those key features you learned about.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,480
It's all the time for our first brief summary

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,770
of what we learned.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,610
And we mostly learned about how to create Vue apps

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,490
and how to connect them to HTML code with mount.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,340
That you should use some unique CSS selector here,

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,930
like here the ID selector because every Vue app

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,380
can only be connected to one HTML element.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,670
And you also see already that

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,630
if you control an element with Vue,

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,750
like here, where we are controlling this section with Vue.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,780
You automatically also control all child elements,

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,530
but not any elements outside

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,720
of this Vue controlled section in this case.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,860
So one Vue app can control one part in the HTML code,

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,930
but it then automatically controls

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,620
all child elements as well.

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,680
Well, and in this Vue controlled HTML code,

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,730
you can use special features.

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,460
Like this interpolation syntax with the double curly braces

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,460
or this binding syntax, this binding directive

24
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,420
with v-bind or v-html, as you also saw before.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,970
These are features which are available

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,520
in that Vue controlled HTML code.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,680
Now you can output data in there,

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,860
Therefore this interpolation, and this binding syntax

29
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,980
is also summarized under the term data binding.

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,610
Because we're binding data,

31
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,610
which be managed in our Vue app to the HTML code,

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,650
either with the interpolation

33
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,800
or with the v-bind directive syntax.

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,700
And that's the important thing.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,010
You pass an object to your Vue app,

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,980
which you create with createApp.

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,110
And this object configures this app.

38
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,130
You can set various options for example,

39
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,540
the data option or the methods option.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,180
Obviously we're going to learn about

41
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,789
other options for the course.

42
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,840
But these are two super important options

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,083
which you will probably meet in any app you're building.

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,560
The data option takes a function,

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,030
therefore you can write it like this.

46
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,640
Which should return an object full of data.

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,330
Which will then be available

48
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,030
in your Vue controlled HTML code, like vueLink here,

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,820
and which can also be accessed

50
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,870
from inside your other parts of the Vue app.

51
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,440
Like the methods with the this keyword.

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,320
Methods are also important.

53
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,630
These are functions which you can call

54
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,920
from inside your Vue controlled HTML code, for example.

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,120
And that's what you'll learn about this far.

56
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,580
Now, therefore, when we work with a framework like Vue,

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,960
we typically say that we use a declarative approach

58
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,490
or that Vue uses a declarative approach.

59
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,770
And that's just a fancy way of saying we,

60
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,740
as a developer define the goal.

61
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,310
We define a template, you could say,

62
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,750
of the content we wanna have.

63
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,350
We mark the parts which are dynamic like this one,

64
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,610
or like this href attribute here,

65
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,530
which is bound with v-bind,

66
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,250
and Vue will then do the rest for us.

67
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,200
It does all the magic behind the scenes.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,020
It outputs concrete values here and here.

69
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,980
And it updates the real DOM.

70
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,590
Which is rendered to the screen and what the user sees

71
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,790
behind the scenes on our behalf.

72
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,150
So we, as a developer just define the final picture

73
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,920
with the dynamic placeholders you could say,

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,039
and we don't define all the steps

75
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,850
of getting that picture onto the screen.

76
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,120
That's what we do with a framework like Vue.

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,090
And that's why we also typically say

78
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,960
that Vue uses a declarative approach.

79
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,730
We just declare our goal.

80
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,600
We don't care about the steps of getting there.

81
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,263
Now it's time to practice this.
