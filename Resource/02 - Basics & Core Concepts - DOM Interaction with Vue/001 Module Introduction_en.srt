1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,540
So, now that we get started with

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,100
Vue JS in the last course module,

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,770
in this module, we're going to explore Vue's core concepts,

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,850
the essentials you've got to know

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,600
when you wanna work with Vue.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,350
Specifically in this module, we're going to dive into

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,530
how exactly Vue interacts with HTML,

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,460
and how a concept called Templates is related to that.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,220
We're going to take another look at

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,450
outputting dynamic content

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,390
and explore more options and alternatives there.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,430
And we'll also react to user input.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,470
I guess we already did this in the first course module,

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,150
but there's more to it, and in this module,

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,703
we're going to explore this in depth as well.
