1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,150
So now we know how to build our Vue app,

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,100
how to output content or bind attributes.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,880
And then we can either set up some data in data

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,005
and refer to that in our HTML code,

5
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:18,033
or then we can also define methods which are called.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,440
It really depends on what you're building

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,923
and what your application goal is in the end.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,794
Now, before we practice those first important concepts,

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:31,240
there are a couple of other things you should know about

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,200
Vue and how to work with its data.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,010
For example, let's say we have our courseGoals

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,350
stored in data properties.

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,160
We've got our coarseGoalA here,

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,930
and we got our coarseGoalB here,

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,680
Master Vue and build amazing apps.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,530
So, we got our two different goals here now.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,890
And instead of returning hardcoded strings here

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,220
in outputGoal, I wanna output one of these two Goals,

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,560
which are defined in data.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,380
This is very easy to do in Vue,

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,790
but it uses a special feature or a syntax,

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,940
which you should be aware of.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,220
Let's say here, if the random number

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,843
is smaller than dot five, I wanna return courseGoalA.

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,570
Now we can't just write courseGoalA here.

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,210
This would not be valid JavaScript.

27
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,870
With this code, JavaScript would look for

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,568
a courseGoalA variable or constant, which it wouldn't find

29
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:33,870
because here courseGoalA is not a variable or constant,

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,793
it's a property of this object.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,780
But instead we can use a syntax,

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,830
which you probably wouldn't think that it works.

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,313
You can use this.courseGoalA.

34
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,270
Now, depending on your level of JavaScript knowledge,

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,390
this might look very strange.

36
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,960
The this keyword is a core keyword in JavaScript,

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,030
and it can be tricky, but in this context,

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,260
this should not refer to this object here.

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,040
It should refer to something else.

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,039
And it normally would, but Vue does some magic here.

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,820
It basically takes all the data you return

42
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,738
in this data object, which you return the data method,

43
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:21,738
and it merges it into a global Vue instance object.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,743
So into your Vue app object, you could say.

45
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,810
So, these three data properties are available

46
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,453
in a behind the scenes managed Vue app object.

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,760
Your methods are also available there.

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,550
And they do have access to anything stored

49
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,250
in that global object through the this keyword.

50
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,920
And that's why in this custom method inside of methods,

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,263
we can use this to refer for example, to our data.

52
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,163
So, we can do this here as well, this.courseGoalB.

53
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:02,980
And if I saved it and reload,

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,910
we therefore now output these different course goals,

55
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,593
which are stored in our data with help of this method.

56
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,520
And having that knowledge of the this keyword

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,150
and what it refers to inside of your methods

58
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,380
in your Vue app, that's important,

59
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,310
because we're going to work with that a lot

60
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,460
throughout this course.
