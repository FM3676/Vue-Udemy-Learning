1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,400
Well, you could of course put your code in here.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,260
Name plus Schwartz Muller, for example,

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,990
you could put it in here.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,180
And if you do that, you avoid this problem.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,300
Now view is able to see what's getting used here

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,610
and it will only updated this paragraph

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,106
and only reevaluated if well,

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,380
in this case name changed

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,500
and output full name has never called

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,091
and therefore will never be called by view.

11
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:33,110
But now we have more logic in our HTML code

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,320
and that's again, not good as you learned.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,630
So there is a third nice feature we can use,

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,193
computed properties.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,240
Computed properties are essentially like methods

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,610
with one important difference view will be aware

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,190
of their dependencies and only reexecute them

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,453
if one of the dependencies changed.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,370
Computed is the third big configuration option

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,640
we learn about for the app we created.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,200
The first one was data.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,850
The second one was methods.

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,870
The third one is computed.

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,560
You can add it anywhere in this conflict object

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,770
here I will add it between data at methods,

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,785
but the position doesn't matter.

27
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:20,785
So you add computed here and just like methods and data.

28
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,240
This is not a name you can choose.

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,830
That is a name you have to use

30
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,600
because it's one of the key options,

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,640
supported by view in view apps.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,620
Computed like methods wants an object.

33
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,745
So you pass an object as a value to compute it.

34
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:41,070
And now in computed,

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,430
you define a bunch of methods just like in methods,

36
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,860
but the methods you defined and computed will be called

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,760
and executed differently.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,989
That's why we have these two different blocks.

39
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:58,000
So here we could add a full name method,

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,250
and I'm naming it full name and not output full name,

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,810
even though I could, because that name is up to you,

42
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,360
but I'm naming it like this because we're going to use this

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,480
like a data property, not like a method,

44
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,570
even though technically it is a method,

45
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,530
but we're not going to use it as such.

46
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,990
We're not going to call it.

47
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,450
And therefore you should name your computed properties

48
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,623
just as you would name your data properties.

49
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,630
And now in here,

50
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,760
we wanna return to value that eventually should be yielded

51
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,630
by that computed property

52
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,800
and there I'll just copy the exact same code

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,700
I had in my output full name method.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,360
So I'll copy that code and put that in there.

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,890
And now, as I mentioned, we can use this full name,

56
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,700
computed property in our HTML code like this.

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,960
And that's important.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,460
Not like this without parentheses,

59
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,010
you don't call it

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,350
you just point at it and view we'll call it for you.

61
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,010
We use it just like we use data properties

62
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,060
like to counter here.

63
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,870
And that's why we should also name our computed properties

64
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,320
like data properties,

65
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,670
because we use them like properties like variables.

66
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,593
We don't use them like functions.

67
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,300
So full name here will be connected

68
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,460
to this full name computed property

69
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,020
so the name of course has to be equal.

70
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,761
And now view will execute this for you.

71
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:30,380
It will basically check

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,590
if there is a full name data property.

73
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,260
And if there isn't, it will check

74
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,940
If there may be as a computed property with the name

75
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,410
and if that's the case, it will execute it.

76
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,070
And hence, if I saved us here in reload,

77
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,100
we see nothing here initially.

78
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,980
But as soon as I start typing,

79
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,570
we see the full name show up again.

80
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,585
So we've got the same behavior as before,

81
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:53,150
but now with one important difference,

82
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,253
let's check the developer tools again.

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,770
In there If I reload,

84
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,250
you will notice running again once initially of course,

85
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,020
because it needs to evaluate the value returned by full name

86
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,923
when the app is first rendered to discreet.

87
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:15,130
But now if I cleared it, if I changed my counter,

88
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,450
we don't see running again and keep in mind

89
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,450
that with a method, we did see it,

90
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,860
but now that's no longer the case.

91
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,540
We only see it if we type here,

92
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,690
which makes a lot of sense because here we really changed

93
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,550
something that's being used in that computed property.

94
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,203
We change the name with every keystroke.

95
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:37,030
So with computer properties,

96
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,210
view is aware of the dependencies

97
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,900
off the computer properties.

98
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,460
So in this case, that name is a dependency

99
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,760
and it will cache the computed property value

100
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,460
and only recalculate and reevaluate it

101
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,940
if one of the dependencies in this case,

102
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,340
the only dependency we have the name property changed.

103
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,410
And that's the key difference for performance.

104
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,170
It's better to use computer properties that methods

105
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,540
for outputting values In most cases.

106
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,820
only use methods if you know that you want to recalculate

107
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,460
a value whenever anything on the page changed.

108
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,300
In most scenarios, that will not be the case.

109
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,659
You only want to recalculate a value

110
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,492
if a dependency changed.

111
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,680
And that's when computed properties shine.

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,560
You still need methods either because you have something

113
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,040
that you really want to reexecute whenever anything changed

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,860
or more often, because you have events

115
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,450
and you wanna trigger certain methods when an event occurs,

116
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,000
that does not change.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,490
You still bind your events to methods.

118
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,330
You don't bind events to computer properties.

119
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,120
You really only use computer properties

120
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,453
for outputting something like here, the full name.
