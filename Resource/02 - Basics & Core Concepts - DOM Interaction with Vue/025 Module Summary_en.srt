1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:09,220
So that's it for the module, and this was a huge course section, of course, since we covered all

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:16,480
the important fundamentals, you need to know about the way you learned how interacting with the DOM

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,940
works and how View manages templates to allow you to use certain view features which are then reflected

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,560
on the actual page.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:35,170
You learned that view has this core idea of letting you define the goal rather than the individual steps

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:43,540
so that it follows that declarative approach where you define how your page should look like and which

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:50,020
parts on the page might be dynamic and you let them view figure out how to get there.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,720
Now, in order to let view do its job, you need to connect your view app, your view instance, the

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,920
actual HTML code with the mound method which you saw.

10
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:10,930
Then you can use a see us as selector to select a part ofthe page and turn that part into the template

11
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:18,150
of the View app in which you then can use all these new features, like, for example, the data and

12
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,410
event binding features you learned about.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,500
You learned that data can be output in that template.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:34,060
So in the controlled HTML code, by using the double curly brace syntax for this interpolation syntax

15
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:42,160
to just output some text which might change over time in a certain place off the page or with the V

16
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,040
directive to bind HTML attributes to some dynamic value.

17
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:56,890
You also learn about the is shorthand notation where instead of the bind colon, some attribute, you

18
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,160
just have colon, some attribute to then bind that attribute to a dynamic value.

19
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,840
And we of course cannot just output data.

20
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:14,120
We can also listen to events with the V on DirecTV or at shorthand notation.

21
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,330
Now these are the powerful core features view is all about.

22
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:27,490
But in order to make these features really powerful and to make them more useful, we rely on views

23
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,800
built in reactivity system.

24
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,140
That simply means that we will update the real DOM whenever some data which you're outputting with the

25
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:45,290
BINDE or double curly braces changes and you learned that you can register data which might change in

26
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,310
the data object of your view app, and that you can also work with computed properties and watchers

27
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,630
to calculate results dynamically or to run some code.

28
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:03,610
Whenever some data changes and view Worchester data for you, it automatically detects changes for you

29
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:11,110
and it will update the DOM and therefore what the user sees on the page whenever such changes are detected.

30
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,320
Now, that's the important foundation you need when working with view, but it's, of course, not just

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,060
about outputting text or data in Web apps.

32
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,930
We also, of course, want to make them look pretty and that involves styling.

33
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:33,550
And here you also can help us with achieving dynamic styling because we can, of course, also said

34
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,200
Sears's classes or inline styles dynamically with the bind.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,050
And you also learned that view has special syntaxes for classes and inline styles to help you assign

36
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,660
dynamic styles to make that easier for you with that object or Arason text I covered over the last lectures.

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,300
Now that's the foundation.

38
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,470
It's of course not all you need to know, but it's the foundation for the rest of the course and you

39
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:09,280
will see the concepts taught in Discourse section throughout all our course sections.

40
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,320
So make sure you understand this.

41
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,760
Go through the lectures, which might not be clear to you at this point.

42
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:23,020
And due to challenges and exercises I offer to you in the section so that you really know what these

43
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,970
core concepts are all about.
