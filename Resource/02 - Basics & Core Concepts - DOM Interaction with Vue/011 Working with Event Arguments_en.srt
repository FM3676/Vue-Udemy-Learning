1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,950
Okay. So we learned quite a bit about events.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,950
What if we now don't just want to add one and subtract one,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,280
but we want to be able to add five and reduce this by five?

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,430
Maybe name it Subtract therefore, whatever you want.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,060
But the goal is that we now don't just add and deduct one,

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,663
but instead five, how would we do that?

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,990
Well, we of course,

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,630
could accept a parameter in those methods, right?

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,760
That is how we would probably do it in JavaScript.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,610
We can accept a parameter, number, or number, or n,

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,690
totally up to you,

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,653
it's your method so you can accept whatever you want.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,560
And then we could add num here or reduce num.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,860
Of course, we could also make this less dynamic

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,170
and just hard-code five here.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,410
The problem just is that whenever we plan to

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,930
change this number, we need to change it down there in code.

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,250
So it typically would be better

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,580
to have a more dynamic method,

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,740
which gets the number which we wanna add or remove,

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,140
and then uses this as a parameter like this.

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,880
Then these methods will never need to be changed

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,300
when we decide to deduct or add a different number.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,270
So that's the more generic and therefore,

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,793
typically better way of writing these methods.

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,760
But how do we tell Vue that it should call

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,780
add and reduce with a value of five

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,310
for these parameters?

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,710
Well, keep in mind,

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,650
we can execute add like this by pointing at it

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,290
or by calling it explicitly.

32
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,840
Well, and if we called it like this, we're as a developer,

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
in full control over the value we wanna pass

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,930
to the parameters of these methods.

35
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,420
So here we can add five for example,

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,680
and reduce by five, just like that.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,670
And now whenever we decide to go for a new value,

38
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,360
we just have to change it here in HTML,

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,098
where we're changing the caption of the button anyways,

40
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,200
and the method will work correctly automatically

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,733
because it's written in a very generic way.

42
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,610
So if we now save that and reload,

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,610
I can add 10 and subtract five and it just works.

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,880
So passing arguments to methods is also possible,

45
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,300
and it's very easy to do,

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,490
and this is an important pattern to know.

47
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,560
This is important to understand, because in reality,

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,870
in apps you're building with Vue,

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,840
you will sometimes have the scenario

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,430
that your method needs to get some parameter,

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,520
which you as a developer want to set,

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,610
and as you see, setting it and telling Vue

53
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,610
to call this method with this value is super, super easy.
