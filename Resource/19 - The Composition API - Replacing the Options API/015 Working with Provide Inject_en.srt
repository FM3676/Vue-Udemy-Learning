1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,300
Now I got two more features I wanna cover

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,950
with the Composition API.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,710
The first one is provide inject.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,190
We're not using it here, but let's say,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,290
instead of forwarding the age to user data

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,790
through the age prop, which of course would be fine here,

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,930
and actually would be the recommended way,

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,010
but instead of doing that,

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,170
let's say we wanna provide inject it.

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,550
So I remove the age prop from user data.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,483
I also remove it there from the props array,

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,570
and now instead, I wanna provide and inject it.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,570
With the Options API, we simply added this provide option,

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,260
which could be a function in which

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,150
we return our provided object, if you remember.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,523
And there, we could have provided our age like this.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,560
Well, with the Composition API, we have an equivalent.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,883
We can import provide from Vue.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,930
So that's another feature exposed by the Vue framework

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,740
which we can import.

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,340
And provide also, like all these things here

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,493
which we import, is a function.

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,430
And we can for example, call it here,

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,570
after I initialize my uAge ref,

25
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,570
and provide a value by passing two arguments to provide.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,570
The first one is a key of your choice.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,660
UserAge, for example.

28
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,870
The second parameter then is the actual value

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,060
you wanna provide.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,913
So here, uAge, this uAge ref.

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,060
And since I'm providing a ref here,

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,700
the places where I will inject it later

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,990
will automatically be updated

34
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,510
and be notified about changes to age,

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,223
so that's a nice thing here.

36
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,220
So now we provide userAge like this,

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,570
and now the only other thing we gotta do

38
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,110
is we gotta go to the place where we wanna inject it,

39
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,100
in this case, user data,

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,620
and now we don't use the inject option here.

41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,620
Instead, we import the inject function from Vue,

42
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,530
and then here, in the set up method,

43
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,530
I can call inject and use the same key I used for provide,

44
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,223
so in my case, userAge here,

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,120
and this will give me this provided value.

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,450
And I can then just store it in a constant of my choice.

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,010
And what I get here will be the value I provide here,

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,120
so in this case, this ref.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,220
So here, age will also be a ref.

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,820
Now you should not change the age from down there.

51
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,080
This would work, but it would be very unpredictable.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,340
As a strong recommendation,

53
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,810
you should only change injected values

54
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,460
in the place where you provide them.

55
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,550
So in this case, in the App.vue file.

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,960
You can absolutely read the injected value,

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,830
or in this case, expose it to the template.

58
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,140
Expose age under the age key,

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,160
and therefore we can use this shorthand,

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,180
and now age is available in the template again,

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,540
even though it's not a prop anymore.

62
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,627
But if we save it, you see the age here,

63
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:29,883
and if I click Change Age, it also updates correctly.

64
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,350
So that's provide inject with the Composition API.

65
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,650
I would argue that it's even a bit easier and less code

66
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,403
than with the Options API.
