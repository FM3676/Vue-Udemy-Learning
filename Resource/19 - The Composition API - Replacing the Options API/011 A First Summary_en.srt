1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,230
Now, that is the core of the composition API.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,090
We covered the core features in the last lectures,

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,250
ref and reactive, computed, watch,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,260
and calling functions from inside the template.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,780
What's really important to me here is that you realize

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,890
that the template code does not change.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,780
We still use interpolation, we could still use v-bind.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,490
We still listen to events in exactly

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,150
the same way we did before.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,010
We can still use v-model.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,433
That's all the same.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,350
Other options we might have, like components or props,

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,130
also would not change.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,380
It's just the logic here and setup which is new,

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,870
and which replaces, as you learned,

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,563
data, methods, computed, and watch.

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,520
Now, of course, still there are many other minor things

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,510
you gotta know when working with the composition API,

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,030
some issues and problems you will eventually run into,

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,870
which you gotta know how to solve when switching

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,560
from the options API to the composition API,

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,930
which is why we will also apply to composition API

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,770
to a bigger project, to see all those

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,923
special cases in action.

25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,730
There are a couple of special cases,

26
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,670
which I wanna cover before we dive into a project though.

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,010
So in the next lectures,

28
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,900
I'll dive into some individual aspects you should

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,463
be aware of when working with the composition API.
