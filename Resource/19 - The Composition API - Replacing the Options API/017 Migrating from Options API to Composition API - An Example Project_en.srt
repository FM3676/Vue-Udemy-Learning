1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,680
So now, with all the knowledge

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,330
about the Composition API

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,940
we gained over the last lectures in this module,

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,040
we can come back to this project I showed you

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,870
in the second lecture of this module,

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,670
where I mentioned why you could consider

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,670
using the Composition API instead of the Options API.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,370
Now, you'll find this project attached.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,400
If you install everything and start the development server,

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,950
you'll see this application here.

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,650
Here you can sort the users, you can filter for users.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,390
It's a very simple filter here, but it works.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,300
You can select a user to view the projects,

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,120
and you can also filter those projects here, if you want to.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,700
So, that is the project we have here,

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,480
and that's entirely built with the Options API.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,810
I strongly recommend that you maybe pause the video here

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,870
and go through the project real quick,

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,950
so that you see how it is built,

20
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,470
how it is made up of different components,

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,960
that you see how the different pieces work together.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,060
In the end, it's not a super complex project,

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,110
it's basically all about having a list of users

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,250
where every user then has a list of projects,

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,010
but we've got a couple of components that work together here

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,060
for displaying the users, for displaying the projects,

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,500
and, of course, also for,

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,743
for example, adding search, and so on.

29
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,600
So, take that break to analyze the project.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
And thereafter, we'll start migrating this

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,310
to the Composition API.

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,670
Of course, you can also try this on your own.

33
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,830
This might be a great practice,

34
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,320
but if you get stuck or if you're not sure,

35
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,500
definitely also feel free to do this together with me.

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,340
Starting in the next lecture,

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,530
we'll dive into this, and we'll migrate this entire project

38
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,893
from the Options API to the Composition API.
