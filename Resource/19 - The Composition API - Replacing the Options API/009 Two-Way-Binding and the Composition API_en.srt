1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,520
So that's how we can use computed.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,680
Let me come back to those inputs.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,620
I mentioned that event listening works just as before.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,640
You can call those methods as you need to.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,410
You can forward the default event argument.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,790
It's forwarded automatically if you just point

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,891
at the method, and you can forward any other arguments

8
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,163
your methods might need.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,500
But you can also use our core vue features

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,040
with the composition API.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,470
For example, V-model to add two-way binding

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,990
in case you want it this year.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,760
So instead of manually listening to the input event,

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,960
and calling our functions here.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,910
Which of course were extended is fine,

16
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,380
but instead of just doing that, you can also use V-model.

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,580
And here's the cool thing, V-model also accepts refs

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,470
and reactive values.

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,910
So here I can just bind first name

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,430
and here I just bind that last name,

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,950
and vue will automatically detect that these are refs.

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,770
And it will update the value properties

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,273
whenever you type into those fields.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,730
So you don't bind dot value, instead, as mentioned before,

25
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,420
in the template, when working with a ref,

26
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,240
you'll always just use the ref like this without drilling

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,800
into the value property.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,743
Vue will do this for you behind the scenes.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,930
So with that we're binding first name

30
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,580
and last name here, but if we save that, we'll see

31
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,160
that it won't work.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,200
If I reload, I'm getting a warning already.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,900
And if I type here, we see no update on the screen.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,350
And the warning is that property last name

35
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,170
was accessed during render but it's not defined.

36
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,730
Wait what?

37
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,780
It is defined here.

38
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,122
Well, it's defined in setup, and we're using it in template,

39
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:57,440
but one thing is missing.

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,800
We're not exposing it to the template.

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,236
Whatever you wanna use in a template needs to be part

42
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:07,610
of that object, you return at the end of setup.

43
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,203
And here, we're not returning first and last name.

44
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,120
We are returning our old update functions,

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,260
but we're actually not using those anymore,

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,240
so we can't even delete them.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,820
Instead, we should now expose first name

48
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,160
and point and our first name or ref.

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,470
Or use the shorthand, if we use the same key name

50
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,630
as we have for the variable name,

51
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,653
and expose last name.

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,510
So we need to expose those two ref's

53
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,190
under any names of our choice,

54
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,550
for example, under the same names,

55
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,423
so that we can access them here.

56
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,870
And now with that, if we save this and reload,

57
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,430
the warning is gone.

58
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,240
And now you'll see two-way binding works just as before

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,483
with refs here.
