1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,930
In this course module,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,830
we are going to explore the biggest

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,540
addition Vue 3 introduced.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,160
So the biggest change from Vue version two to three,

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,790
in case you're interested in that

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,903
we're going to explore the Composition API.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,500
The Composition API gives us a different way of building

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,010
our components of writing our component code.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,750
But I will already say not a totally different way.

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,640
The template, the styling that stays the way it is,

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,690
the props and custom events concepts

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,950
that stays the way it is.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,610
the JavaScript code you write that,

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,630
however, changes if you use the Composition API,

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,100
and I will also already say

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,100
the Composition API is 100% optional.

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,210
You don't have to use it.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,930
I'm not teaching you everything I taught you thus far

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,510
in the course, just to now tell you that it's obsolete.

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,620
No, what you'll learn thus far

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,200
is the basis of Vue and absolutely fine,

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,320
but you can move to this new Composition API,

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,350
or even mix it with what you learned thus far,

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,403
if you like to.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,370
But with that, let's get there step by step.

26
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,410
In this module,

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,330
I will start by explaining

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,850
what exactly the Composition API is

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,700
and why it exists.

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,113
Why we have these two different ways of building components.

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,880
We'll then understand the Composition API.

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,930
We will learn how to work with it

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,040
and how to write code with it.

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,950
And of course,

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,680
I will show you how you could move from the Options API,

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,480
which is the name of the approach we used thus far

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,250
in the course to the Composition API, if you want it to.

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,203
So let's dive in.
