1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,040
What if we wanted to use

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,810
the dollar sign route object?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,940
Maybe, also because we're not just interested

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,840
in our route parameters,

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,803
but in the query parameters or in the path.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,410
Now, as mentioned before,

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,710
that this key word does not exist here.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,400
So we can't access this dollar sign route,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,463
and we can't access this dollars sign router,

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,380
but we can import something

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,193
from vue-router that will help us.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,270
We can import a couple of built in hooks,

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,770
also called composables.

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,250
Now what are hooks or composables?

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,890
In the end these are different terms

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,600
for a special kind of function,

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,560
hooks, composables, custom composition functions.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,550
These are special functions written in JavaScript,

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,660
which are built for the composition API.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,300
So for being used inside of the setup method,

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,050
these functions internally typically use some composition

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,153
API features like Refs or Computed.

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,150
In a separate module later about reusing functionality

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,070
you will learn how to build your own hooks,

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,960
your own custom composition functions

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,600
here the vue-router team did this for us.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,810
And it's giving us a couple of functions,

28
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,060
a couple of composition functions,

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,160
also called hooks or composables,

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,650
which you can call inside of the setup method

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,330
to then get access to certain features

32
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,880
that work together nicely with the composition API

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,920
and useRoute, for example,

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,910
allows us to get access to this route object,

35
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,333
here like this.

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,090
If we do this, I can console log route here.

37
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,630
And if I do that, save this, and reload

38
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,350
and opened that console we see that is a reactive object

39
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,002
and there for a proxy with all that route data in there.

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
And since it's reactive,

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,300
we can of course watch it or use it in computer props

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,740
to update any data that depends on it,

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,970
whenever route changes.

44
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,820
So with that instead of props PID,

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,000
we could also use route parents PID here

46
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,130
that would be possible.

47
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,273
And then of course we don't need props.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,100
So if we use that go to the carpet, it works just as before,

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,400
but now using this route object,

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,170
which we get with help of the useRoute hook

51
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,750
or custom composition function

52
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,800
also sometimes called composable,

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,310
whatever you wanna call it,

54
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,733
which is provided by the vue-router package.

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,740
And another composable another hook

56
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,310
which is also provided by vue-router

57
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,900
can help us with the programmatic navigation

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,480
and add product here in submit form in this function

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,480
I wanna navigate to the all products page

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,550
As soon as a product has been added

61
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,820
in the options API world,

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,480
we would use this router push

63
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,180
and then go to slash products, for example.

64
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,350
In the composition API world,

65
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,460
the, this keyword doesn't exist and hence this doesn't work,

66
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,400
but again, the vue-router team has got us covered

67
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,660
from vue-router,

68
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,997
we can import useRouter,

69
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,870
so not to useRoute like before,

70
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,573
but now use router.

71
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,970
And we can call this anywhere in our setup method like this,

72
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,363
to get access to this router object.

73
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,950
And now we can simply call router push

74
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,110
using that router object we create

75
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,870
by calling that custom composition function

76
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,083
provided by the vue-router team.

77
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,113
So if we now save that and go to add product,

78
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,452
and I enter some data,

79
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,300
and click add product,

80
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,080
we're navigated to the all products page.

81
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,780
And that is all I wanted to show here.

82
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,410
This is how you can use the vue-router in components

83
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,130
that use the composition API.

84
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,320
Generally, the router works just as before

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,430
you define routes in the same way,

86
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,620
and you can use all the features you learn about.

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,370
But when it comes to dynamic parameters

88
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,530
possibly passed to a component as props

89
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,340
or when it comes to using the route or router object,

90
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,040
this is how you can use these features

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,730
by using the custom composition functions

92
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,980
provided by the vue-router package or by using props

93
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,467
as I showed it to you a couple of minutes ago.
