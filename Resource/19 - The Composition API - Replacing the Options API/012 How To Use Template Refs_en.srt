1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,140
Let's start with refs.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,640
And now I don't mean refs in the setup method,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,490
which are our reactive values.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,193
But I mean, refs referring to elements in our template.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,120
Let's say for the LastName, for whatever reason,

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,133
we don't want to use the model.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,541
Instead here, I want to use set a ref

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,708
LastNameInput.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,450
And I want to use the approach you saw a couple of times

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,510
throughout the course, where I read the value

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,460
from an input by using this $ ref's variable

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,700
inside of some method in our config object.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,500
So let's say we want to do the same here.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,610
So we have a button here,

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,610
Set Name, where upon a click,

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,230
I want to call some setName function,

17
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,580
and that function should then set the LastName.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,080
Actually therefore, I will name it setLastName

19
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,013
and name the function setLastName.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,930
Now, of course, first of all, we created that function.

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,513
So we add a new function in the setup method setLastName.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,420
This function receives no arguments.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,292
But in here, I now want to set LastName.Value,

24
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:25,290
referring to the value prop of my LastName ref here

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,410
equal to the value stored in this input.

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,650
And for this, historically, with the options API,

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,670
we would have used this $refs,

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,040
and then our ref name here, which is LastNameInput.value

29
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,230
This won't work here though, because

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,840
inside of the setup method, you don't have access to this

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,050
as you're used to.

32
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,170
You won't find $refs thing there.

33
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,290
Instead, the approach is the other way around you could say.

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,180
Now you've defined your refs, including your template refs

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,670
like this one, in the setup method.

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,130
There is no differentiation between your own refs

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,330
that manage your own data, and refs you want to bind

38
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,873
to some DOM element.

39
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,940
So here you simply create a new ref LastNameInput

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,653
by calling ref.

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,670
The initial value here is now because initially

42
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,360
this is not bound to any element in the template.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,770
But now we can simply expose LastNameInput to the template

44
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,400
by returning it here.

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,870
Maybe instead of LastName, which we now don't need

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,480
in the template anymore.

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,151
We now expose LastNameInput, and also already

48
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:48,230
the setLastName function here.

49
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,020
So expose this function as well.

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,023
So now this new ref and this function is exposed.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,130
And now LastNameInput is bound to this input here

52
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,380
because we're using the same name here.

53
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,840
And you still assign a ref like this,

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
just a string with the ref name that you created

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,730
in your setup function.

56
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,440
So LastName and put here, once it's exposed to the template

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,660
like this is then available under that name

58
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,730
for this special a ref prop, which you can set

59
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,230
on any DOM element of your choice.

60
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,780
And Vue will make the connection behind the scenes.

61
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,000
And with that, we'll be able to go to our setLastName

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,620
function here, and simply get the value from that input

63
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,513
by accessing LastNameInput.value.value.

64
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,810
Now this might look strange, this .value.value thing,

65
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,100
keep in mind you always get access to the value of a ref

66
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,020
with .value.

67
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,030
And the value of this ref will be a pointer

68
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,890
at this input element object.

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,520
And this object in turn will also have a value property,

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,240
holding the user input.

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,260
So the second .value is getting access to

72
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,340
that value property of the input element object,

73
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,310
the first .value gets access to the value of our ref,

74
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,543
which then is that input element object.

75
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,980
With that we get access to the user input,

76
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,079
and we're setting our LastName equal to it.

77
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,130
And therefore, with all of that if we save this and reload,

78
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,690
I can enter max here, my watcher fires and I see max here.

79
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,700
But if I type here in the LastName,

80
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,580
this does not update automatically,

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,080
because we removed two way binding.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,570
Instead, I can now click setLastName, and it works.

83
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,823
And it also of course, triggers the watcher.

84
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,083
So that's how we can work with template refs.
