1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,240
So for updating the UI,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,140
I got two main areas.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,280
And that's this register as coach button,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,900
which I wanna replace if we're not logged in.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,650
And requests also shouldn't be visible here

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,850
if we're not logged in.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,053
Instead, maybe we wanna show a login button.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,790
For that, I will start in my getters

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,650
in the auth module though.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,530
So, there in getters.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,273
I'll add a new getter isAuthenticated.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,580
And here, I wanna check if we are authenticated.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,230
And how can we tell whether we are authenticated or not?

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,030
Well, if we got a token, then we are authenticated.

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,360
Because we start without one,

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,410
and I will later reset it

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,890
once we added a log out functionality.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,180
So, if we have a token, we are authenticated.

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,870
So, I will return state.token;

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,340
and convert this to a true Boolean

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,573
by adding the double exclamation mark again.

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,110
Now, we can use the isAuthenticated getter

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,890
into different parts of this app.

24
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,810
For example, under a coach's list.

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,770
Here, we have this register as coach button,

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,550
and that should not be visible if we're not even logged in.

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,240
Instead, I wanna show a login button or link instead.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,670
So, therefore, we can add a new computed property

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,049
here to coach's list,

30
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:31,049
the isLoggedIn computed property, for example,

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,220
where I return this.$store.getters.isAuthenticated;

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,420
Since this module is not namespaced,

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,573
we can access the getter just like this.

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,240
Now, we can use isLoggedIn

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,470
and only show this register as coach button

36
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,090
if we're not a coach,

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,730
we're not loading and we are logged in.

38
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,550
So, if we are logged in and we're not a coach

39
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,780
and we're not loading,

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,500
then I wanna show this button.

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,330
And, of course, you could also put this all

42
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,180
into one computed property

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,613
to take this logic out of the template.

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,710
Now, I will add a new base-button here,

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,723
which will act as a link to="/auth"

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,300
where I say login if we are not logged in.

47
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,750
So, if we're not logged in,

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,010
if we're not logged in,

49
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,363
this button will be shown.

50
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,450
Now, with that saved,

51
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,560
here we see the login button.

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,410
And we click it,

53
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,780
we go to the login page.

54
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,430
Now, for the navigation bar,

55
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,633
that's TheHeader in the layout folder under components.

56
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,560
And here, we now also need to add a script,

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,110
to add a computed property

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,913
to get access to our getters.

59
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,390
I will also add a isLoggedIn getter

60
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,720
at our computed property here

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,720
and return this.$store.getters.isAuthenticated;

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,343
That getter we added a couple of minutes ago.

63
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,370
And I'll only show this list item

64
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,310
with the requests link if we are logged in.

65
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,310
Otherwise, I'll show a different list item

66
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,393
with a <router-link to="/auth"

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,003
where I say login.

68
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,010
With that, if we save this,

69
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,850
we now see login here as a navigation item.

70
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,850
If I do log in, you see,

71
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,310
we have requests instead,

72
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,620
And on all coaches,

73
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,090
we would see the register as coach button

74
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,920
if we wouldn't be registered already.

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,090
So, now let's also add a log out button

76
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,120
and a log out functionality

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,340
and check a couple of other things we can do

78
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,073
here on our front end.
