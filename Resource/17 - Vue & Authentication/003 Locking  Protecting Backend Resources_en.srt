1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,180
So two add authentication

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,030
I will first of all ensure

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,070
that Firebase doesn't grant access to all resources

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,880
at the moment it does that

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,290
because in their real time database which we're using

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,457
under rules we started in this test mode

7
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:21,600
where we in the end allow reading and writing

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,937
to all resources that are exposed by Firebase.

9
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:28,850
And that's definitely not the idea here

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,430
we definitely don't wanna do that anymore

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,230
instead only some resources should be accessible by anyone

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,420
and other resources should be protected.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,760
For example in our app here,

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,020
the list of coaches here

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,180
and sending a message to a coach

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,940
that should be available to everyone

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,900
on the apprehend viewing the requests here

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,837
and then also signing up as a coach

19
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:01,770
that should only be available to log in users

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,024
and we can tweak the Firebase rules to make sure that

21
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,950
this is all the reflected on the backend.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,960
Now, if you're not using Firebase,

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,890
if you wrote your own API for example with note JS,

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,100
you'll of course have to write

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,600
a code to check this on your own on the backend

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,970
here with Firebase and the real time database,

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,902
we can tweak those rules a little bit

28
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:27,090
to control how read and write access is granted.

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,580
So how does this work here with Firebase?

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,020
In this rules object here

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,220
you'll see those read and write keys

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,290
and then that in the end is a value

33
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,300
that resolves to true or false.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,930
Now we can rewrite these rules a bit.

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,850
And for that I'll quickly have a look at my data first,

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,990
we have to keep in mind that

37
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,691
we've got coaches and requests now in the end

38
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:56,480
we wanna allow reading of coaches to everyone,

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,100
but saving a new coach

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,110
that should not be possible for everyone

41
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,330
and for the requests sending

42
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,650
so saving a new request should be available to everyone,

43
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,900
but reading should be restricted.

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,750
So the effort in the rules here,

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,110
we can dive into the rules object,

46
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,100
and here we can actually add coaches

47
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,950
because we have a data node called coaches in our database

48
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,960
and now we can set up read and write rules

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,600
for that part of the database.

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,490
We can do the same here for requests

51
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,800
to set up read and write rules for requests

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,100
and then we can have general reader write rules

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,233
that apply to the rest of our database.

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,510
So, which share rules do I wanna have here?

55
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,300
For the coaches I wanna make sure that

56
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,117
any data in that data note

57
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:53,040
can be read by anyone

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,140
and for that we set the dot read rule here to true.

59
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,990
This makes sure that everyone has full read access,

60
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,920
but write, dot write should be restricted

61
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,250
we can set this to false

62
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,260
and then no one would be able to write,

63
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,210
but I will actually set it to a string

64
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,793
where I check if off is not equal to null.

65
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,940
Now off is a special variable

66
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,040
available in the Firebase rules which will be not null

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,060
if we added a valid token to the request,

68
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,900
as long as we don't send along any token it will be null.

69
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,703
So then this is null and then writing will be denied.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,320
Now, I'm just showing you these rules here

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,995
because it's not a Firebase course

72
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:43,410
if you plan on using Firebase for your own project,

73
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,740
you can dive into the official Firebase talks

74
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,463
to learn all about these rules.

75
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,870
Now for requests we have exactly the opposite

76
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,565
read is denied if we're not authenticated,

77
00:03:55,565 --> 00:04:00,565
but writing is actually possible for everyone.

78
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,280
And these are very simple trivial rules

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,743
which you could definitely refine a bit more.

80
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,700
Now we can get rid of these general read and write rules

81
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,923
here and then publish our new rules.

82
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,160
If we do that and go back to our application,

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
we can reload the coaches page and that works,

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,660
but on requests we now get an error

85
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,200
because we fail to fetch our requests

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,357
and we get back a four 0 one error

87
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:36,357
unauthorized because now Firebase is blocking access here.

88
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,490
It's not allowing us to fetch requests

89
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,700
because of our new rules.

90
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,590
The same would happen if we tried to register as a coach,

91
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,863
if I send some data here,

92
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:55,750
you see, we also get back the four 0 one response here

93
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,650
We don't have error handling in the app

94
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,750
which is why we don't see a modal here,

95
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,093
but that request clearly failed.

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,360
Now we update it to date on the front end here,

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,190
because that's how our app currently works

98
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,090
But if I reload you see that data isn't really there.

99
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,860
Now of course these are all things

100
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,080
we're going to fix throughout this module.

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,800
Now last but not least if I try to send a message

102
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,743
that should succeed,

103
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,980
we can view it in Firebase in data if we go to requests

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,370
we see there we have a new message,

105
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,630
the message I just sent

106
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,910
because writing two messages is something we allow.

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,500
So with that we tweaked Firebase

108
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,580
and now we need such a token.

109
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,280
And for that we first of all

110
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,710
need a way of letting the user log in and sign up.

111
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,860
So let's add a sign up and log in page

112
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,130
then sent that day to Firebase in exchange for a token.

113
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,563
And then thereafter work with that token.
