1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,070
So time to add a signup page.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,350
For that here under pages,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,890
I will add a new subfolder, auth.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,900
And in there, add the UserAuth.vue file,

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,720
which will hold our user authentication form.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,880
And as I just said it,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,553
in here, I wanna have a form.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,670
A very simple form

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,120
where we maybe have a div with a class of form-control.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,650
And then inside of that div,

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,410
we have a label for the email field

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,280
where we say E-Mail

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,140
and below that, we have an input of type email

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,160
where users should enter his or her email address.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,283
So I have an id of email here.

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,250
And then we can copy that to do the same for the password.

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,700
So here we have type password, id=password

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,573
and we say Password on the label.

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,070
And below that, we have the base-button

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,450
where we say Login.

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,680
And the caption of this button should change,

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,970
depending whether we wanna log in or not

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,830
because I'll add a second button here

24
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,680
where I set the type to button

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,730
so that this button won't submit the surrounding form

26
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,500
where I say Signup instead.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,780
And where I set the mode to flat.

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,940
This will ensure that this allows us

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,253
to switch between signing up and logging in.

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,710
Now, for some styling,

31
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,710
I think we can reuse the styling we find on another page,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,923
the ContactCoach page.

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,623
Here we can grab the styling defined here.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,530
I don't grab the errors

35
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,970
and don't grab the actions

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,570
because I'm not using this here.

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,520
And simply add styling to this component now

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,940
and yes, we could try to set this up

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,100
as general app-wide styling

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,450
or create separate components and hold inputs

41
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,720
but I will just copy those styles here

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,769
and repeat the styling code a little bit.

43
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,220
And one thing I forgot,

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,220
I also wanna put all of that into a base-card component here

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,333
for some nice styling.

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,760
Okay.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,870
Now, that's the basic UserAuth page.

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,590
Let's now bring it to the screen

49
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,400
so that we can fine tune it.

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,310
And it should be loaded as a route.

51
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,330
So in the router.js file,

52
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,830
we can register a new route.

53
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,880
Maybe here right before our catch all route,

54
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,100
which is /auth let's say

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,480
where the component is this newly added component.

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,480
So we import UserAuth from ./pages/auth/UserAuth.vue.

57
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,850
That's the component we just added here.

58
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,320
And now, UserAuth is the component

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,533
that should be loaded when we visit /.auth.

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,220
So with that added,

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,190
if we now enter /auth,

62
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,460
and of course, we'll soon add navigation options

63
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,183
to get there, this is this component.

64
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,240
Now, one thing I wanna change here in the styling,

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,060
the form shouldn't have this border,

66
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,070
doesn't need the border radius.

67
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,640
We can get rid of that.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,140
Now this looks better.

69
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,010
And actually, I will also swap this

70
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,870
and move the form into the base-card

71
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,320
and not the other way around.

72
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,250
Yeah, this now looks better.

73
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,230
So now we've got this form.

74
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,140
This button will submit the form.

75
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,559
This button will later help us switch

76
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,930
between signing up and logging in

77
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,700
because of course, this form should be able

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,763
to handle both.

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,180
And speaking of that,

80
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,850
let's maybe continue with this form right away

81
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,600
and let's make sure that we do gather some user data

82
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,990
and that we do send this to Firebase thereafter.

83
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,620
So for that, back in the UserAuth component,

84
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,170
we, of course, need a script

85
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,490
and we've got some data we wanna manage here

86
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,930
because for example, we wanna manage the user input.

87
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,740
That will be an email address

88
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,880
and that will be a password.

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,142
Now, you can also add more complex validation

90
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:24,990
as we did it in the CoachRegistration component,

91
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,430
in the CoachForm to be precise.

92
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,580
You could do this here in UserAuth

93
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,630
but we practiced this before.

94
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,850
Here I wanna focus just on authentication,

95
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,553
so I will add only very basic validation here.

96
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,280
For example, I will add a formIsValid key,

97
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,860
which initially is true.

98
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,820
And we'll set that to false

99
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,550
if the user submits the form

100
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,720
and email or password should be invalid.

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,040
We also need to be able

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,730
to switch between signup and login mode

103
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,520
because that will change which action

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,820
will be dispatched later,

105
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,530
which HTTP request should be sent.

106
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,660
So therefore, I will also add a mode data property here

107
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,050
and set this to login initially

108
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,340
but this can also be signup

109
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,480
once we added the logic.

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,770
And that's the next thing.

111
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,130
Let's add some methods.

112
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,613
submitForm is one method.

113
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:20,553
SwitchAuthMode is another method.

114
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,940
submitForm, well, you guess it,

115
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,766
should be triggered when the form is submitted.

116
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,740
switchAuthMode should be triggered

117
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,723
when this switch button here is clicked.

118
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,080
So we can already wire this up.

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,590
Wire up this second button

120
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,150
and point at switchAuthMode.

121
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,640
And on the form, add the submit event handler

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,320
with the prevent modifier

123
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,080
and point at submitForm.

124
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,110
Also, connect the inputs with v-model

125
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,120
and connect this one to email

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,313
and the second one to password.

127
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,600
With that done, we can start with submitForm

128
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,910
and check if this.email is empty

129
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,900
and actually, therefore,

130
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,010
I wanna use the trim modifier again

131
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,233
to trim any excess white space.

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,290
So check if email is then empty.

133
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,180
Or if not this.email.includes an @ symbol,

134
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,600
which is a very trivial validation

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,750
of whether we have an email address or not.

136
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,500
Or if this.password.length

137
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,560
is smaller than six characters.

138
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,310
I think that's the minimum Firebase actually wants,

139
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,230
if any of these conditions is met,

140
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,900
then we set formIsValid to false

141
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,163
and we return so that no other code executes.

142
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,760
And we set formIsValid to true initially

143
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,640
when the form is submitted to clear any errors

144
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,420
we might be displaying

145
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,880
because we can now use formIsValid

146
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,610
to show an error message, maybe here in the paragraph

147
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,780
with v-id, check if formIsValid.

148
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,150
Or if it's not valid to be precise

149
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,690
and then show a message

150
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,633
of Please enter a valid email and password.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,670
Must be at least six characters long.

152
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,210
So now we've got this as well.

153
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,833
And that's the basic validation I wanna do here.

154
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,040
Now, if we make it past this if check,

155
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,990
we will then send an appropriate http request

156
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,750
for logging in or singing up

157
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,030
but that will be the next step.

158
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,284
First, let's work on the AuthMode

159
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:45,210
and here I wanna check if this.mode

160
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,280
is equal to login,

161
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,890
so if we are currently in login mode,

162
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,247
in that case, I'll set mode to signup.

163
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Else if we are in signup,

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,093
I'll set mode to login.

165
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,220
And now we can use this mode data property

166
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,950
to control what's displayed on the button here as a caption

167
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,770
but then also, to later change which kind

168
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,813
of HTTP request is sent here.

169
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,640
Now, to change the button captions,

170
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,300
I will use computed properties

171
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,820
to keep that logic in the script here.

172
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,890
And here, I'll have the submitButtonCaption

173
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,347
and the switchModeButtonCaption computed property.

174
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,430
And on the submitButton,

175
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,179
I wanna check if this.mode is equal to login.

176
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,873
And if that's the case, I'll return a caption of Login.

177
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,370
Else we are in signup mode.

178
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,653
I will say Signup.

179
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,640
And for the switchModeButton,

180
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,520
I'll basically do the same.

181
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,870
I will also check in which mode we are.

182
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,710
And if we are in Login mode,

183
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,780
I'll say Signup instead

184
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,970
because that's the new mode this button should toggle.

185
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,800
If we are Signup mode,

186
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,603
I'll say Login instead.

187
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,520
And now we can use these computed properties here.

188
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,880
So here on the submit button,

189
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,920
I output my submitButtonCaption

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,800
with interpolation and here on the switch button,

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,423
I output my switchModeButtonCaption.

192
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,933
Okay.

193
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,400
Now we can click the Switch button

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,610
and we switch between those modes

195
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,730
but at the moment, this, of course,

196
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,710
only affects what we see on the screen

197
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,600
but that's better than nothing.

198
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,180
Now, as a next step,

199
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,660
we need to really get that user input

200
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,430
and then send that data to Firebase

201
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,150
to exchange it for a token

202
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,793
or to create a new user to start with.
