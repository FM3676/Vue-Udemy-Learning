1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,320
So in this module,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,640
we added authentication to this application.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,050
With that, we can signup and login,

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,190
and you saw all the different pieces that you can add

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,690
to an application to, well, add authentication.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,060
We used Vuex for the different actions

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,810
and for sending the HTTP requests,

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,770
and we also used it to manage the log in and log out status,

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,300
and to also log the user in and out automatically,

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,360
for example, when the token expired or after a page reload.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,220
Now, these are some of the key features

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,000
which you will most likely need

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,310
in any application you're building.

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,570
Here, I'm using Firebase as a dummy backend,

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,220
but the general idea is always the same.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,140
If it's your own backend, if it's an API,

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,060
which it typically will be,

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,420
it will definitely also send back some kind of token,

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,630
which you need to store and which you need to manage

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,870
and which you need to attach to outgoing requests.

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,560
So therefore, what we did in this module

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,760
does not just apply to Firebase, but with slight variations

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,980
of course, to any backend you might be connecting

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,130
to any Vue app.

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,090
Therefore, I hope it was helpful

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,970
and I hope all these core concepts

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,973
are clear and understandable.
