1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,090
Now in order to use that enter data,

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,310
and create a user on Firebase,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,470
or get such a token.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,350
We need to go to the Firebase console

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,223
and there to authentication.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,010
And here you need to set up a sign in method.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,620
You can also do this here under the sign and methods tap.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,320
And here we want to go with email password

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,430
and enable this only this first one click save

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,260
And now Firebase supports creating users

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,580
with email password.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,980
And of course it also supports logging those in.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,770
Now, if you Google for Firebase off arrest API,

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,560
you also find the Firebase docs

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,450
for the rest API day offer

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,620
for creating users and signing users in

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,930
the two end points here are interesting

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,640
sign up with email password

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,840
sign in with email password.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,730
This only works once you enabled

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,753
authentication in your project though.

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
So these are the end points

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,020
to which we now want to send requests

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,970
from inside our view app to create a user

25
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,000
and get a token or log a user in.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,880
Before we sent that, though

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,280
we can write some code here

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,230
because I don't want to send the request

29
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,910
from inside this component.

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,170
But again, i want to use view UX,

31
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,480
because it will also be UX

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,090
in which we later need to store that token

33
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,150
and stored the information

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,420
wherever the user is logged in or not,

35
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,670
because Dad log in mode in which we are,

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,740
will affect what we want to display on the page here,

37
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,560
for example, in the navigation.

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,363
So we need that as app white state.

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,160
Now for this, we can create a new module,

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,910
the off module,

41
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,640
or we managed as, as a root state

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,150
in our main store object.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,450
So to say,

44
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,760
Now I will go for a separate module.

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,430
The Auth module

46
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,430
and in their Eta index.jS fall mutations.js

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,970
actions.JS and getters.js

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,110
So what we did before as well,

49
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,419
and in our main store module here,

50
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,910
I will then import the auth module

51
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,490
from thought slash modules off in index.js

52
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,463
and add it here under auth key.

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,180
Now here's one thing which i won't do.

54
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,490
I will not namespace the auth module

55
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,850
for one simple reason

56
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,490
because in the past i managed my user ID here

57
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,980
as a global state.

58
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,830
And I don't want to change all the code

59
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,440
all over the application

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,060
where I use this user ID getter, for example.

61
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,200
So I will now take that getter

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,700
and remove it from here,

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,460
but by not name spacing this module,

64
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,400
when that module is added to our roots store,

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,360
all the gatherers and so on are still accessible as before,

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,513
and therefore we don't need to change any ABRA code.

67
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,770
So with the however,

68
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,290
I will grab this getter object here,

69
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,930
remove it and remove togethers key here

70
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,100
and go to my gatters.js file in your folder

71
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,880
and export that object

72
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,050
and grab the state here,

73
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,610
this state, this entire state actually.

74
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,750
Cut it as well.

75
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,010
And add this to index.js

76
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,680
here i export a default object

77
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,363
and here I'll bring in that state.

78
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,220
And here we then also import mutations

79
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,070
from mutations.js

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,910
import actions from actions.js

81
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,310
And of course all the import getters from getters.js

82
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,560
and add all those things to this off module object.

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,410
So add mutations

84
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,340
actions,

85
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,180
and getters.

86
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,150
Using these JavaScript shorten's

87
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,500
and now we just need to export empty objects

88
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,330
in actions and mutations.

89
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,260
We got our getter and getters.

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,130
And with that, we now are using that off module.

91
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,720
Here i now want to define actions

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,910
for logging in and signing up.

93
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,610
And of course, all the mutations

94
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,023
that will be committed once that succeeded.
