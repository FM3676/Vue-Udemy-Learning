1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,580
So let's work on the feedback,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,330
we're providing to the user

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,980
both in the error case

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,660
as well as whilst we're

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,723
waiting for the request to be sent.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,160
Now in our action,

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
the signup action,

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm using async await,

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,230
therefore as you learnt already,

10
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,920
this always returns a promise.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,300
Sometimes it returns a promise that fails,

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,003
for example, if we throw this manual error.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,120
So with that we can go back to UserAuth

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,510
and there add two new keys

15
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,040
to the data we're managing here.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,380
isLoading, which is false initially

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,800
and error which is null initially

18
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,323
and in submit form,

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,830
if we make it past the validation step,

20
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,010
I'll set this isLoading to true

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,740
and then once we're done dispatching here,

22
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,260
I'll set this isLoading to false.

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,270
Now for that we need to wait for this action

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,520
to finish though,

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,590
otherwise we set this instantly to false,

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,040
after this has been dispatched

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,879
without waiting for the response

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,210
and therefore I'll this into an async function as well,

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,439
async method submitForm

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,893
and we can then await this dispatching action.

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,050
In addition, we can wrap this all

32
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,230
with try catch,

33
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,850
this if block here,

34
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,640
so that we catch any error

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,800
that might be thrown

36
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,650
and we can then set this error equal to error.message

37
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,820
or to a fallback message of

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,580
Fail to authenticate, try later,

39
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,530
anything like that.

40
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,070
You can of course

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,310
also fine tune the error message you're throwing here

42
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,573
inside of your action.

43
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,620
Check your login data, for example

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,220
but you can also be more specific

45
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,800
for example by drilling into that response object

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,760
you get back from Firebase.

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,410
Here you can really fine tune this

48
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,940
to your requirements

49
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,430
but with that back and user off,

50
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,710
we try catch this,

51
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,960
we set the error.

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,590
Now we just need to reflect the loading state

53
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,990
and the error on the user interface

54
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,613
and I will do that with help of my base dialog.

55
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,410
I'll add a base dialog here

56
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,230
and wrap this all into a div

57
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,610
so that we don't have multiple root level components

58
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,640
because as you learnt,

59
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,640
that's not something the transition component wants

60
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,370
but then I have a base dialog here,

61
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,450
where I actually wanna show a loading spinner

62
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,750
and therefore I'll use this fixed prop,

63
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,350
which we also have on the base dialog,

64
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,330
you might remember

65
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,720
that I talked about that

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,660
when I added the base dialog component.

67
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,680
It ensures that the dialog can't be dismissed

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,520
and I'll bind show to isLoading,

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,920
as long as we're loading

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,690
this dialog will be shown

71
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,890
and inside of that dialog,

72
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,410
I then have a paragraph,

73
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,230
where I say authenticating

74
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,470
and below that I show my base spinner

75
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,130
and I'll add another base dialogue,

76
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,193
which I wanna show in the error case.

77
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,430
By the way, on this other dialog,

78
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,580
I'll first of all also set a title,

79
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,653
where I also say authenticating,

80
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,910
I guess we can then get rid of the paragraph though.

81
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,020
So let's get rid of that,

82
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,980
just show the spinner

83
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,730
and say Authenticating in the title

84
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,950
but now back to the other dialog here.

85
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,990
I wanna show this if we do have an error,

86
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,080
so with this double exclamation mark trick,

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,560
I ensure that this true or false value

88
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,343
is converted to a Boolean.

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,280
Can set the title here to

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,090
An error occurred

91
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,490
and then inside of that dialogue,

92
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,880
I add a paragraph

93
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,133
where I output my error message like this.

94
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,803
With that added,

95
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,400
if we save it all

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,610
and go back,

97
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,480
go to sign up mode

98
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,950
and I entered the same email address as before

99
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,142
and I click Sign up,

100
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:19,976
we see that spinner

101
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,142
and then that error dialog.

102
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,330
Dismissing doesn't work at the moment as I can see,

103
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,610
because obviously we should listen

104
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,650
to the closed event on the error dialog,

105
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,483
not on the other one,

106
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,860
because the loading dialog is dismissed automatically

107
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,660
but the error dialog should be dismissed by us

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,690
with a handle error method,

109
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,430
we should add,

110
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,990
in which we simply reset our error data property.

111
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,800
So here I'll add handleError

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,440
in the methods of this component

113
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,090
and set this error back to null.

114
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,840
With that it's a false value

115
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,073
and then this will no longer show the dialog.

116
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,120
So with that,

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,610
back in the app,

118
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,433
if I again try this with an email I already used, we fail,

119
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,693
if I use a valid email,

120
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,963
for signing up we succeed.

121
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,930
So that works now,

122
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,800
we got that visual feedback.

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,700
We also might want to redirect the user thereafter

124
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,580
but that's also something I'll focus on later

125
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,420
because what I wanna do at the moment,

126
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,730
is also make login work

127
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,853
and then do something with the token.
