1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,210
Now to add a log out functionality

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,230
here in the header,

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,140
I'll add a nother list item

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,513
with a base button in it,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,323
where I say,

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,573
log out.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,295
Gives us this button

8
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,390
and then buttons should do just what it says.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,010
It should log us out.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,210
Of course this list items should only be visible

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,880
if we are locked in,

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,540
because it makes no sense to show a log out button,

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,993
if we aren't locked in.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,680
And now we need to add a new action,

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,620
and that's the log out action.

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,950
So here in the off module in the actions file,

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,780
I add a log out action.

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,500
And now logging out is really trivial.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,790
We don't need to send any request

20
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,570
because you might remember that I said that the server

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,920
doesn't store any information about us anyways.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,760
So there's no need to send a request.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,610
Instead, the only thing we gotta do

24
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,230
is clear all that data here,

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,683
set it back to null.

26
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,350
Hence, we get our state

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,870
and we can simply set state token equal to null,

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,920
state user ID and set is equal to null,

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,190
and state token expiration and set it to null.

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,920
And that's all we gotta do.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,240
Now, since we, for example,

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,360
checking our is authenticated headed gather,

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,910
whether we have a token,

34
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,650
this we'll set is authenticated header to false.

35
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,500
Once we set the token to null,

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,540
because that then is an invalid token.

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,373
Now of course though,

38
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,280
that's not the valid way of doing it.

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,610
That's an action, not a mutation,

40
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,980
we got a mutation set user already.

41
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,450
And in the end here, we are setting the free fields

42
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,930
which we wanna reset.

43
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,560
So we just need to pass a payload

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,700
with null values for all those fields.

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,690
So in the log out, action,

46
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,690
we actually get the context of the state

47
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,290
but then here we should simply context commit,

48
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,940
set user,

49
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,760
and pass in our payload object,

50
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,470
where token is null,

51
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,570
user ID is null,

52
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,440
and token expiration is null

53
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,130
for the same reason as just explained.

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,073
That's now a proper way of doing it.

55
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,110
And with that action added back in the header,

56
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,480
we can add a click listener

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,610
to this log out button

58
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,140
and in our script then add methods

59
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,300
and add a log out method

60
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,940
where we reach out to our store

61
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,793
and dispatched this log out action.

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,233
And now this log out method can be connected to this button.

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,730
And if we do this once this reloads,

64
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,933
we can log in,

65
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,940
let's say with test2 user

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,640
like this

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,010
now on all coaches, we also see the register as coach button

68
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,390
because this user isn't registered yet.

69
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,200
We can go to requests and we can click log out

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,560
and we see that updates.

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,640
Now, one thing that doesn't update

72
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,020
neither when we log out, nor when we log in,

73
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,440
is the page on which we are.

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,870
Now, if we do log in, it would be nice

75
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,610
if we would be redirected

76
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,470
back to the coaches' page for example.

77
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,230
If we do log out and I'm on requests,

78
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,640
it may be, would be nice,

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,720
since I can't technically go to requests anymore,

80
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,810
if I all did would be redirected somewhere else.

81
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,080
So let's work on that

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,793
routing and redirection part next.
