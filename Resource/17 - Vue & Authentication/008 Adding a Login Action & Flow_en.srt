1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,880
So, to make "Log in" work,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,200
we can go back to our Vuex actions.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,720
And here, the "Login" action.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,120
We can already add "Async."

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,030
Because, we will definitely also send that HTTP request

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,140
in here.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,940
We can copy this code from "Signup."

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,400
Because, we sent the same kind of data.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,140
We also send a post request.

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,890
But, the URL will be different.

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,650
If we have a look at the Firebase Auth REST API docs.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,480
Here, under "Sign in"; which is "Log in."

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,073
It's this URL, which we need now.

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,150
It has the same request body payload though.

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,373
So, grab this URL and replace it.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,883
Here, up to your API key. Which is the same.

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,360
And with that, this should work.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,760
Of course, you could also refactor this into some function,

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,700
to have less code duplication.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,430
But, I like to be explicit here.

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,913
So I will keep it like this.

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, we still wanna get the response data,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,110
check for errors, and commit some action at the end.

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,183
So, we can copy all of that, as well.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,900
And with that, we should be pretty good!

26
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,180
We can also commit the same mutation,

27
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,110
because we get the same data back.

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,720
It's really just the URL that's different.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,250
That, then, ensures that we're logging in,

30
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,360
instead of signing up.

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,170
But, other than that we're doing the exact same thing.

32
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,160
And again, therefore, if you wanted to,

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,859
you could absolutely, also, refactor this to be one action,

34
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,830
where we control the URL with a payload, for example.

35
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,463
Or, anything like that. But I'll go for two actions here.

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,760
And of course, also get my "Context and payload."

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,993
Here, on the "Login action." And with that done,

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,400
we now, can dispatch this action.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,077
So back in "UserAuth."

40
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,743
Here,

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,367
I want to: "Await this.

42
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:05,320
$store.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,874
dispatch/

44
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,933
('login')" and send the same payload as before.

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,680
Now, we can, of course, also refactor this.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,933
For example:

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,770
create an "ActionPayload" constant,

48
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,720
which holds this object.

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,450
And then simply use this object,

50
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,283
here

51
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,113
and here.

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,740
So, that we are reusing at least a little bit of code.

53
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,330
So, now we're dispatching these actions.

54
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,560
We're waiting for them. We're showing feedback.

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,060
And if we give this a try

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,490
and save that,

57
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,260
back in our

58
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,820
application here.

59
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,930
If I use an email address and a valid password,

60
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,830
and I click "Log in," this looks like a success response.

61
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,703
If I use an invalid password, I get an error.

62
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,480
So, that's looking good!

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,950
With that,

64
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,910
we can now start using that token.

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,930
and attach it on outgoing requests.

66
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,380
So, that, we again are able to register as a coach

67
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,720
and view requests.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
Because at at the moment, this of course, fails.
