00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,420
In the last course section,

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,273
we worked on this course project here.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,250
In this course section,

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,380
we are going to continue working on this project,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,770
but we will focus on one specific aspect,

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,450
and that's authentication.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,840
We will add users, real users to this application.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,540
To be precise, we'll make sure

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,200
that you can log in and sign up

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,890
and that you then can become a coach

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,443
once you are signed up.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,930
Therefore in this module,

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,160
we'll explore how authentication actually works

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,040
in Vue apps and which steps we need to take to make it work.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,390
We'll then, as I just said, add log in, sign up and log out,

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,120
and we'll also add a check to keep users locked in

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,230
if they logged in in the past

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,040
and then leave the page and then come back.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,223
So plenty of things to cover, let's dive right in.
