1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,450
Besides the transition property,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,310
which we can use to tell CSS

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,720
to well provide a transition between two changes,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,340
we can also set up a more detailed animation.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,340
For that we first of all have to define an animation in CSS.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,940
And we do this by writing @keyframes,

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,070
and then any name of our choice,

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,920
for example, slide-fade

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,550
but again, this name is up to you.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,940
Now, in here you can define in detail

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,080
how the animation should behave,

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,410
and which different states it should have

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,610
and you express this with percentages.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,610
You for example say that at 0% of animation completion

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,800
so at the start you for example,

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,410
want to have transformation along the X axis of zero

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,300
so it hasn't been moved.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,390
And in addition, you set the scale to one.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,000
Scale is a number transform function which you can add

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,843
to change the size of a block.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,510
Then let's say after

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,900
70% of the animation time,

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,110
you want to change this,

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,810
to move it to 120 pixels to the left

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,190
and scale it up a little bit,

26
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,040
make it 10% bigger by setting the scale to one dot one

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,780
one is the original scale,

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,813
one dot one is 10% bigger.

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,650
And then here at 100%,

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,850
we want to translate X to

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,560
the full minus 150 pixels.

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,470
So move it the entire way to the left

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,430
and set scale back to one.

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,530
So that we just bump up the size

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,260
in the middle or a little bit after the middle

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,530
of the animation and move it almost

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,810
to the end here at this point and entirely

38
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,170
to the end here and bring it back to its normal size.

39
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,150
And these are different states we have in our animation now

40
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,470
that's now our defined animation

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,820
and the different states the so called keyframes

42
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,280
wanna reach during that animation.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,410
And we now apply this by going

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,830
to our block first of all,

45
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,440
and removing transition there.

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,260
We can move transition and animation together if we want to,

47
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,833
but often you'll use just one of the two.

48
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,050
So here I want to use an animation

49
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,130
hence I comment out transition.

50
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,900
And in the class which we add eventually,

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,810
I'll comment out transform,

52
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,820
and instead add the animation CSS property.

53
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,650
That property now allows us to add an animation when

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,363
that CSS class is added to an element.

55
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,880
Here, we now refer to one of our keyframe sets,

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,960
which we defined so in this case at slide-fade.

57
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,480
So using this name here,

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,830
then we still specify a duration

59
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,270
which will be split up across these key frames.

60
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,240
So here, let's say dot three seconds.

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,120
And also easing function,

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,520
which controls how fast these different states

63
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,710
are reached if we start fast and end slow,

64
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,913
or if we start slow and end fast.

65
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,770
If we save all of that, and reload,

66
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,530
if I click animate,

67
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,130
you see it animates,

68
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,210
but then it snaps back to the original state.

69
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,220
That's not a bug

70
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,410
that's how CSS animations behave by default,

71
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,970
we need to add four words here to tell CSS

72
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,930
that we want to keep the final keyframe the final state

73
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,740
as the new look the new state of the animated element.

74
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,330
So by adding four words here, if we save that and reload,

75
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,600
if I click animate,

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,070
it now moves over there with our custom animation

77
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,310
and keeps that final state.

78
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,880
And that's how we can implement animations

79
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,890
with CSS transitions or CSS animations.

80
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,520
And all we're doing with view here

81
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,370
is we're adding this animate class dynamically

82
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,090
two to two be animated element,

83
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,330
which of course also doesn't have to be a div

84
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,760
but could be anything.

85
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,310
And often that is all you need.

86
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,130
But there also is a scenario where this is not enough.

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,132
So let's explore that, next.
