1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,200
We now gained a lot of knowledge

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,180
about important concepts

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,580
and features which you need in Vue applications.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,210
There is one thing which is missing,

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,630
which you don't need in any application,

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,360
but which helps in a lot of applications.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,040
And that would be transitions and animations,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,440
moving things around and doing so in an animated way

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,970
to help users understand your user interface,

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,630
to provide a better user experience.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,130
Technically, transitions

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,780
and animations are totally optional,

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,780
but they often make your UI and UX much, much better.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,030
And therefore in this module,

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,020
we'll start by understanding transitions and animations,

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,120
how they work and how you can make them work with CSS.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,900
We'll then learn how Vue.js can help us with animations

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,750
and where exactly we need its help.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,660
And then we'll also see that animating lists is

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,750
a bit different than animating other things,

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,090
which we'll dive into first in this module,

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,273
and therefore we'll cover this as well.
