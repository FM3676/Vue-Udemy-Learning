1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,630
So what would be a scenario where these

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,130
basic CSS transitions and animations might not be enough?

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,470
Well, first of all, and that's really important.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,360
CSS animations and transitions will very often be enough,

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,810
but adding them like we're currently doing it,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,090
that might not be enough, and here's an example.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,660
In our running application, if I take show dialog,

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,570
this model dialog pops up immediately,

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,308
it's just there and it's gone when we close it.

10
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:32,980
This might be fine.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,909
This might be absolutely the behavior you want,

12
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,760
but sometimes you might wanna animate it in.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,260
You want to have a little animation

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,360
when it appears and the same for removing it.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,450
And that is the part that will be tricky

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,200
with just CSS animations and with just adding CSS classes

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,630
with Vue as we did before,

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,740
especially when you also want to animate the disappearance.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,060
Let me show you why it's tricky.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,570
We can go to the base modal,

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,470
which holds to code for this dialog

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,860
and there on the dialog selector here,

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,080
we can add a little animation.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,750
We can for this again, to find some key frames here

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,750
and give it any name of our choice and I'll name it modal.

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,600
But again this name is up to you and I'll start at 0%

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,980
and I wanna go to 100%.

28
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,570
And if you just define two styles, two states,

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,740
as I'm doing it here,

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,740
you can also use the from and to shorthands basically.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,390
And now here we define the starting state

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,870
and there let's say the modal should initially be invisible

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,830
by setting the opacity to zero with transform translate Y,

34
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,543
I will move it up on the Y axis by 50 pixels.

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,380
And I will actually also scale it from zero dot nine

36
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,230
to its final size.

37
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,050
And speaking of final, in to, I now add the final states.

38
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,200
Opacity one, translate Y of zero

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,060
to reach the real position this element should have

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,640
and scale one to reach the real size

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,890
this element should have.

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,820
And now we could this modal animation

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,097
to our dialog selector to basically make sure

44
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:24,410
that every dialog we're selecting with that.

45
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,510
So the only dialog we have here receives that animation.

46
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,480
And by default,

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,790
the animation will be played when the element

48
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,420
is then first being part of the page.

49
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,563
So the animation starts instantly.

50
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,582
We can utilize this here, with animation I can point at my

51
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:45,940
modal animation here, give it a duration, ease out

52
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,740
and important, add forwards to tell CSS

53
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,993
that the final state should be kept.

54
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,890
And if we now save everything, when I click show dialog,

55
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,150
we have this little animation here, as you can tell,

56
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,760
and we have this animation because the animation is part

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,570
of the dialog selector.

58
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,370
So whenever this selector finds something on the page

59
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,580
and it will find something when the dialogue is added

60
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,929
to the page, which I do in app Vue in the end

61
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:20,920
with v-if on my custom component, the whole component

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,880
is only added if dialog is visible as true

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,590
and therefore the dialogue element in the component

64
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,120
is only added under that circumstances.

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,343
And therefore whenever that is the case.

66
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,523
This here, this animation will be played thanks to that key,

67
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,560
but the problems start if we all do want to animate

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,800
the removal of the element,

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,100
if I wanna do that, currently it disappears instantly.

70
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,560
The problem we'll have is that the element

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,493
is detached from the DOM.

72
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,460
And that means there is no way to animate it with CSS.

73
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,670
It's removed instantly.

74
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,620
You can't play an animation and then tell the browser

75
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,525
to only remove it once that animation is finished,

76
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:07,480
but that is what you would need to do

77
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,430
in order to animate the disappearance.

78
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,030
And that's exactly what Vue is able to help us with.

79
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,045
Vue can help us with animating the appearance

80
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:21,360
and also the disappearance of elements by for example,

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,390
delaying the disappearance

82
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,803
until a certain animation has finished.
