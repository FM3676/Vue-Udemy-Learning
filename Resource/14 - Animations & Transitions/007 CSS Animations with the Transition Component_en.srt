1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,980
Now transition cannot just be used

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,670
with the transition CSS property

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,220
just to make this clear,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,770
you can also use it to apply an animation.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,910
Now we already have an animation here,

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,340
slide and fade, it's actually not really fading,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,020
I guess it's more of a slide and scale animation.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,290
So maybe let's use this as a name.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,710
And let me show you how we could add this

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,903
with this transition wrapper component.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,020
So on this paragraph,

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,750
I mentioned that view would add these special

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,210
CSS classes v-enter-from and so on.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,050
Now, if you don't want to use this transition way,

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,510
because maybe you have a more

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,420
complex animation with different steps,

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,200
you can do this as well.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,150
Now we don't need all classes in that case though,

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,350
we don't need v-enter-from

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,130
because we have no starting state

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,910
and we have no end state.

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,570
Instead, it's all defined in the animation.

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,510
So in the end, we just have animation in v-enter-active.

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,520
Then I point at the slide-scale animation

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,680
to find the duration

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,883
which you will read as you learned and ease-out.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,120
You don't even need four words here,

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,860
because you need to keep in mind

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,870
that all those special classes are being removed

30
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,340
once the animation is over.

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,753
So once this duration which Vue reads is over,

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,450
and therefore the final end state

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,900
you will see on the screen is just a regular styling

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,490
you defined for this element

35
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,260
with the other CSS rules you have.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,160
So here we don't need four words

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,790
because this class is also getting removed

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,230
once the animation is over

39
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,430
so it can't jump back because it doesn't even know

40
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,403
the animation anymore once it is, well, over.

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,000
Now we can do the same for a leaving though.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't need a from state, don't need a to state

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,750
but for v-leave-active of instead of transition.

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,750
We can use animations slide-scale .3 seconds ease-out.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,110
If we now save that and reload.

46
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,170
Now we got this other style here.

47
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,480
Now it's the style from the square from before.

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,310
That's why it looks a bit strange here,

49
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,200
but you can tell that it works.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,530
So using CSS animations with the wrapper

51
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,823
with this transition wrapper component is also supported.
