1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,570
So let's now apply what we learned about transition,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,700
about this transition component, to our modal.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,105
Because that was the thing where I explained

4
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:15,440
that we might need more help from vue's side.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,770
Especially for having a transition and animation,

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,420
when we close it.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,020
Now we can wrap transition around our own custom components,

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,410
just as we can wrap it around built-in elements.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,940
So we can use transition here,

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,683
around our base-model, just like that.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,210
Now we can, of course also set the name prop

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,090
to define our own prefix for all

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,530
those special classes you will add.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,730
And I will add modal here.

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,193
But again, you can pick any name you want.

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,360
And then we can dig into our CSS code

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,840
and start to finding those CSS classes.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,380
And here I'll add a modal-enter-from class,

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,379
a modal-enter-active class and a modal-enter-to class.

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,990
And I will actually go to BaseModal.vue

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,120
and make sure that I removed the animation

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,250
from the modal there.

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,720
So that we don't see this animation anymore.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,093
So make sure you comment as out or remove this line.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,090
And then let's go back to App.vue,

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,300
which is where we're using the base-model

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,890
and where we are wrapping it with transition.

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,180
And now we can define our different styles here.

29
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,070
And it's now of course, totally up to you,

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,800
how you want to animate this modal.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,363
I will actually bring over my modal keyframes here.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,023
So the keyframes from the BaseModal.vue file,

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,430
add them here, to App.vue.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,670
You can have multiple sets of keyframes

35
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,080
in the same style tax,

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,670
as long as you're using different names.

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,660
And I actually don't even need to enter

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,210
from an enter-to now.

39
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,820
We just need enter-active to play at animation

40
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,000
and this will be the modal animation,

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,603
which i just copied over,

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,723
give it a duration and a ease-in function.

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,500
And if we do that, we'll notice a problem.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,223
If we reload, this modal has no animation.

45
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,320
Now, this transition component

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,980
does work on custom components.

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,810
But we have a problem here.

48
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,570
The classes vue wants to add are added

49
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,710
to the root element of your custom component.

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,550
This is ,this attribute fall through behavior

51
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,023
I talked about earlier.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,280
So these classes transition wants to add

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,980
fall through to the root element

54
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,150
in the template of base-model.

55
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,013
But base-model happens to have two root elements.

56
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:57,230
There's div and there's dialogue.

57
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,040
If we comment out the div for a second,

58
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,240
if we remove that div, the backdrop for a second,

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,230
and then reload, you see, it works.

60
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,790
Now we have this animation for showing the modal.

61
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,710
But if we have both root elements here,

62
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,820
which you of course want, then this does not work.

63
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,886
And it doesn't work because as I mentioned before,

64
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:24,886
this transition component wants one direct child element.

65
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,400
Yes, it has just one child element here,

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,410
just one base-model.

67
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,400
But of course the base-model here,

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,520
is really just a wrapper around its template,

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,060
where we have two root elements.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,790
So these two root elements, this div and this dialogue,

71
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,110
these are the actual direct child elements

72
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,620
inside of this transition component.

73
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,300
Well, and two elements are more than one.

74
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,343
That's why this set-up here does not work.

75
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,100
What can we do about that?

76
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,260
How can we work around that?

77
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,910
Well, there are various ways of solving this.

78
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,330
We can, for example, split this into two components

79
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,060
and manage the backdrop separately.

80
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,870
But we could also bring this transition component

81
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,350
over to base-model and try using it in there

82
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,610
to transition to style log.

83
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,630
And that's the route I will take here.

84
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,356
I'll remove the transition wrapper

85
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:24,423
around my custom component.

86
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,660
Though it theoretically would work,

87
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,890
if our custom component had just one root element,

88
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,240
but here it doesn't, so it doesn't work.

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,060
And I will bring it over to base-model

90
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,950
and wrap this dialogue with transition, like this.

91
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,972
Now I can give this a name of, modal

92
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:46,800
and go back to App.vue,

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,220
and grab my modal specific CSS classes,

94
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,670
to be precise to modal-enter-active class here,

95
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,170
we can remove them from App.vue,

96
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,330
remove the modal keyframes from App.vue

97
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,260
and bring all of that over to BaseModal.vue.

98
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,650
There, we already got the modal keyframes,

99
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,630
and now I'm also adding the modal-enter-active class,

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,670
which points at the modal keyframes

101
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,423
to play it as an animation.

102
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,450
Now, however, we need to change the logic,

103
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,020
how this base-model opens.

104
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,910
At the moment, I'm adding the base-model component

105
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,090
in App.vue with v-if.

106
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,540
And this won't work, if I want to use transition

107
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,590
inside of the base-model template

108
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,950
to animate the addition and remove of dialogue.

109
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,750
If transition is part of that template,

110
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,880
which has added and removed with v-if,

111
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,563
it won't have any effect.

112
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,920
Therefore I'll now open and close the modal differently.

113
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,920
I'll add a new open prop, to my base-model component

114
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,850
and point at dialogue is visible there.

115
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,550
So forward, the dialogue is visible property

116
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,453
through the open prop to the base-model component.

117
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,760
And now in the base-model component,

118
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,090
we can accept this prop here.

119
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,753
So expect the open prop here.

120
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:12,370
And now that we're getting it,

121
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,510
we can simply add it here with v-if.

122
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,150
We can check open, so does open prop,

123
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,030
which is true or false, to control whether or not

124
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,783
the dialogue is visible or not.

125
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,700
So now the base-model component is always added

126
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,600
to the App.vue template,

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,110
but inside of that base-model template,

128
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,240
the dialogue is still controlled with v-if.

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,230
But now it's wrapped in a transition,

130
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,763
and now this transition has only one direct child.

131
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,300
And of course, we also want to add v-if here to the div,

132
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,680
and pass the open prop to v-if as well,

133
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,113
to control the visibility of the backdrop.

134
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,750
And now finally, if we reload, we got this animation

135
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,623
and everything works properly.

136
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,650
And we can, of course now also work on a closing animation.

137
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,170
We can add modal-leave-active here,

138
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,640
and play the same animation.

139
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,740
Let's say with an ease-in function,

140
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,640
just to keep things simple.

141
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,090
Of course, we could also play

142
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,970
a totally different animation here,

143
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,560
or a set-up a transition

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,010
by also using the from and to classes.

145
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,210
But if I do it like that, if I now reload,

146
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,780
we got a animation for opening, and also for closing.

147
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,950
Now the closing animation, certainly is a bit off

148
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,763
because I'm just re-using the opening animation,

149
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,550
but we can add the reverse value here to this animation

150
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,490
on modal-leave-active, to tell CSS,

151
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,250
to actually play this animation in reverse,

152
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,230
for this case here, for this CSS class selector.

153
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,620
So that it will start at, to and go to, from,

154
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,113
if you add reverse.

155
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,500
And with that, if I save that and reload,

156
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,540
we've got a nice animation for opening and also for closing.

157
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,430
And now, that is enabled with help of transition.

158
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,400
Keeping in mind, that transition

159
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,300
must only have one direct child element.

160
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,950
And therefore, we had to restructure this a bit,

161
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,510
and I hope it's clear why we had to do it.

162
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,840
But with that, we now got a nice transition

163
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,360
for opening and for closing.

164
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,610
So for adding and for removing,

165
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,163
this element to the done.

166
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,192
Now I'll dive into some cases,

167
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,760
where we actually are allowed to have

168
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,523
more than one element inside of transition.
