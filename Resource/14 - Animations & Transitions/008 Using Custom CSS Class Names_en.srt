1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,100
Now what if you had

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,530
multiple transition components

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,100
on your page though?

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,120
Because maybe you don't just want to animate the removal

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
and addition of this paragraph,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,643
but also off this div or of any other element.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,880
Theoretically, that works, but you will face a problem.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,630
Vue always adds the same CSS classes to all elements,

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,440
which basically means you will use the same animations

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,390
and transitions for all elements.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,050
Maybe that is your requirement.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,470
Maybe that is what you want,

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,580
but maybe you want different transitions

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,660
for different transition components on your page.

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,200
And that's why you can customize those names here.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,210
We could, for example name this para-enter-from

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,880
para-enter-active, para-enter-two,

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,890
and the same for the leave classes

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,560
instead of the v- thing at the beginning.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,960
But with that Vue of course wouldn't know

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,209
that these are the CSS classes it should add and analyze

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,460
instead with just the names changed here,

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,510
we have no animation because Vue will stick to its default

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,653
v-enter-from, v-enter-to and so on class names.

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,430
We need to tell Vue that for this transition component here,

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,640
it should add the para-classes

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,240
and we do so by adding a special name prop

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,720
to the transition component.

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,790
Here you add your custom prefix, which in my case is para,

30
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,733
but which can be anything you want.

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,320
And if you do that

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,630
now these para-enter-from, enter-active, enter-to.

33
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,550
And so on classes will be added and managed

34
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,533
and analyzed by Vue.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,990
So now with that, if you reload the animation is back.

36
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,470
So this name can be set and customized

37
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,667
so that you can have multiple different transitions

38
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:03,370
and transition component usages most importantly,

39
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,033
in the same component.

40
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,090
Now, one more word about the naming here.

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,540
You can define your own custom prefix,

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,720
as I explained here with the name prop

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,100
in cases where you wanna replace the entire class names.

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,470
So you don't wanna work with para-enter-from,

45
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,270
para-enter-active, para-enter-to and so on,

46
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,040
but you wanna use totally custom CSS class names here,

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,210
for example, because you're using some third parties,

48
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,090
CSS animation library,

49
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,090
which gives you certain classes you need to add

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,480
where you can't change the names.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,400
For such cases, you can add more props here instead of name

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,510
you can add, enter-to-class prop

53
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,530
and define your enter-to-class name,

54
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,260
enter-active-class prop and so on.

55
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,320
So here you can, then define your CSS class names

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,420
that should be added during the enter-to phase

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,170
the enter-active phase and so on.

58
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,320
So instead of v-enter-to or para-enter-to,

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,820
you would then add some class and so on.

60
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,750
Now that's not what I'm doing here.

61
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,580
I'll revert this to name equal para,

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,460
but I want to make you aware of that,

63
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,330
so that you know that you have full flexibility

64
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,890
when it comes to these names.

65
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,830
And when it comes to which CSS classes

66
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,913
are added at which point of time.
