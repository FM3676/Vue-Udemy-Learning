1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,430
Now, you know the game.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,700
Attached you find a starting project,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,660
run npm install to install all dependencies we got in there.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,340
And once that is done and out of the way,

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,020
you can run npn run serve

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,910
to bring up that development server

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,550
which hosts this demo app.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,870
Now here's the app we'll be starting with.

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,870
And to be honest, it's more of a playground than a real app.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,360
We've got a modal here which can open and close.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,740
But it's really just there

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,040
so that we can practice animations,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,890
but will not start with the modal.

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,030
We'll start with this square.

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,480
With this dark purple square here.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,617
And we'll see how we can animate that with CSS

17
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:43,530
and also Vue.

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,000
And then we'll also see where we need more support

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,163
from Vue side and how we get that support.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,970
So how can we animate things? Let's start simple.

21
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,080
Let's say we want to click this animate button.

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,160
And well, then this square here,

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,050
this block should be animated.

24
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,420
And for that, we can go back to our code.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,420
To App.vue which is where I have this block.

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,310
This div with the class block.

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,760
And we'll start by adding a click listener to animate.

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,880
Sort of we can write some Vue code

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,420
that should do something with that div.

30
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,780
And I wanna start very, very simple.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,350
I wanna start by simply moving that block

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,390
a little bit to the left, let's say.

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,273
To achieve this we can add a new method.

34
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,760
Animate block, sounds like a fitting name for that.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,870
And that's the method which should be triggered

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,123
upon a click. So let's wire this up.

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,600
And I wanna manage some data here,

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,390
which basically controls

39
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,970
wherever we wanna animate the block or not.

40
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,660
So whether we clicked the button or not.

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Animated block is the data property I will add for that.

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,113
And it's a simple Boolean and starts with a false value.

43
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,430
Now that's just one way of implementing this,

44
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,450
but this is a very simple demo

45
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,220
which we can build like this.

46
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,400
So we get the animated block data property here

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,970
in the App.vue file.

48
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,680
And we can now utilize this data property

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,560
to add a CSS class to this div conditionally.

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,420
Because we can animate things in web development

51
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,420
with just CSS. We don't technically need JavaScript for it.

52
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,750
We might just need JavaScript to start the animation,

53
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,130
to add certain CSS code.

54
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,840
But thereafter, CSS can do that on its own.

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,960
So here we could add a dynamic class binding

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,110
to bind the animate class let's say.

57
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,760
This class name is up to you.

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,200
Whenever animated block.

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,290
So this newly added data property is true.

60
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,323
When that's true, the animate class will be added.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,030
And we can now define this animate class here in our styles.

62
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,010
I'll add a brand new class animate.

63
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,090
And to move the block around,

64
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,730
we can for example use the transform CSS property

65
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,820
which is a built in CSS property.

66
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,280
Has nothing to do with Vue.js

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,480
and there we can add translate X

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,690
to move an element around on the X axis.

69
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,600
And the transform property is perfect for that

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,350
because it moves elements in an optimized way.

71
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,890
It gives us great performance essentially.

72
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,573
So here we could move it by, let's say, 50 pixels.

73
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,380
So now to finish this up,

74
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,350
we just need to go to this method we added before

75
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,630
and set this animated block equal to true here.

76
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,280
And with all of that, with that property,

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,460
which be used to add the animate class dynamically

78
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,330
and that animate class to find down there.

79
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,700
With all of that set up.

80
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,670
If we save that we can click animate

81
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,370
and we see that block move a little bit.

82
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,540
We can actually also move it a bit further by for example,

83
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,853
deducting 150 instead of 50 pixels.

84
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,510
But what you'll see of course is that

85
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,430
this is an instant jump. It's not an animation at all.

86
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,890
It's just a instant jump to its new position.

87
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,490
Now this is not what I want here.

88
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,500
I want a smooth animation.

89
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,940
And implementing that is super easy with CSS.

90
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,170
We can simply go to this block class,

91
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,040
which is the base CSS class this div has.

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,830
And on that block class here,

93
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,490
we can add the transition CSS property.

94
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,950
Which is another built in property CSS offers.

95
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,973
It has nothing to do with Vue.

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,690
The transition property takes a couple of values.

97
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,200
It first of all wants to know

98
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,080
which other CSS property we wanna transition.

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,913
For example,

100
00:04:56,913 --> 00:05:00,000
we could say that we want to animate the opacity.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,050
But here on this block, we're never changing the opacity

102
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,940
so this makes no sense.

103
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,360
We can say all, to animate any changes

104
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,630
in any animatable CSS properties.

105
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,720
Or we target transform specifically since we know

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,420
that we're going to change the transform property.

107
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,370
Initially on this base class,

108
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,970
we're not saying anything about transform.

109
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,780
And then later we set it to translate X -150 pixels.

110
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,300
So when that kicks in,

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,350
transition with the transform value here

112
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,350
tells CSS that any changes applied to the transform property

113
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,723
or with help of the transform property, should be animated.

114
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,963
And therefore

115
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:47,390
besides the name of the property we wanna animate,

116
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,650
we also have to provide a duration

117
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,500
over which this animation should be done.

118
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,240
For example, 0.3 seconds.

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,310
Now, as a side note.

120
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,080
If you wanna learn more about that,

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,100
the potential values you can set up here

122
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,270
and how CSS animations work.

123
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,610
You might wanna check out a dedicated CSS course

124
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,330
or some free CSS animation resources

125
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,580
which you'll find out there.

126
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,480
I'll not dive too deeply into that here

127
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,890
since it's still a Vue course in the end

128
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,963
and not primarily as CSS or CSS animations course.

129
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,970
Nonetheless here, we now animate changes

130
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,660
and transform over 0.3 seconds.

131
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,260
And we kind of find that easing function

132
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,090
which basically determines how this animation accelerates

133
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,390
and then throttles at the end.

134
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,870
If we now save that. You'll see if I click animate,

135
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,040
now this animates.

136
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,190
And this moves in the duration we specified.

137
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,870
And we are using Vue here to start this animation

138
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,150
by setting animated block to true.

139
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,660
Initially it's false but we set it to true here.

140
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,950
And that adds the animate class.

141
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,560
So that's the part where we use Vue.

142
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,500
But thereafter it's just CSS.

143
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,800
And it's just the transform property combined

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,503
with the transition property.

145
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,100
And that's important. This is a perfectly fine way.

146
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,330
It's not just fine.

147
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,230
It's actually the recommended way

148
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,120
for adding animation like this.

149
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,110
Now there is an alternative for cases where

150
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,980
a simple transition like that is not enough though.

151
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,453
Let me show you that alternative as well.
